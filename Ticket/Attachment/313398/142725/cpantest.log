# CPAN is the world-wide archive of perl resources. It consists of about

# CPAN are easily accessible with the CPAN.pm module. If you want to use
# CPAN.pm, lots of things have to be configured. Fortunately, most of
# them can be determined automatically. If you prefer the automatic
# configuration, answer 'yes' below.
# 
# If you prefer to enter a dialog instead, you can answer 'no' to this
# question and I'll let you configure in small steps one thing after the
# other. (Note: you can revisit this dialog anytime later by typing 'o
# conf init' at the cpan prompt.)
#

# 
# The following questions are intended to help you with the
# configuration. The CPAN module needs a directory of its own to cache
# important index files and maybe keep a temporary mirror of CPAN files.
# This may be a site-wide or a personal directory.
# 
# 
# 
# I see you already have a  directory
#     /home/hwadm/.cpan/build/CPAN-1.9101-SW7TPG/t/dot-cpan
# Shall we use it as the general CPAN build and cache directory?
# 
# CPAN build and cache directory? [/home/hwadm/.cpan/build/CPAN-1.9101-SW7TPG/t/dot-cpan]
# 
# 
# 
# Unless you are accessing the CPAN via the filesystem directly CPAN.pm
# needs to keep the source files it downloads somewhere. Please supply a
# directory where the downloaded files are to be kept. [/home/hwadm/.cpan/build/CPAN-1.9101-SW7TPG/t/dot-cpan/sources]
# 
# Directory where the build process takes place? [/home/hwadm/.cpan/build/CPAN-1.9101-SW7TPG/t/dot-cpan/build]
# 
# Until version 1.88 CPAN.pm never trusted the contents of the
# build_dir directory between sessions. Since 1.88_58 CPAN.pm has a
# YAML-based mechanism that makes it possible to share the contents of
# the build_dir/ directory between different sessions with the same
# version of perl. People who prefer to test things several days before
# installing will like this feature because it safes a lot of time.
# 
# If you say yes to the following question, CPAN will try to store
# enough information about the build process so that it can pick up in
# future sessions at the same state of affairs as it left a previous
# session.
# 
# Store and re-use state information about distributions between
# CPAN.pm sessions? [yes]
# 
# 
# 
# CPAN.pm can store customized build environments based on regular
# expressions for distribution names. These are YAML files where the
# default options for CPAN.pm and the environment can be overridden and
# dialog sequences can be stored that can later be executed by an
# Expect.pm object. The CPAN.pm distribution comes with some prefab YAML
# files that cover sample distributions that can be used as blueprints
# to store one own prefs. Please check out the distroprefs/ directory of
# the CPAN.pm distribution to get a quick start into the prefs system.
# 
# Directory where to store default options/environment/dialogs for
# building modules that need some customization? [/home/hwadm/.cpan/build/CPAN-1.9101-SW7TPG/t/dot-cpan/prefs]
# 
# 
# 
# Normally CPAN.pm keeps config variables in memory and changes need to
# be saved in a separate 'o conf commit' command to make them permanent
# between sessions. If you set the 'auto_commit' option to true, changes
# to a config variable are always automatically committed to disk.
# 
# Always commit changes to config variables to disk? [no]
# 
# 
# 
# How big should the disk cache be for keeping the build directories
# with all the intermediate files?
# 
# Cache size for build directory (in MB)? [100]
# 
# 
# 
# The CPAN indexes are usually rebuilt once or twice per hour, but the
# typical CPAN mirror mirrors only once or twice per day. Depending on
# the quality of your mirror and your desire to be on the bleeding edge,
# you may want to set the following value to more or less than one day
# (which is the default). It determines after how many days CPAN.pm
# downloads new indexes.
# 
# Let the index expire after how many days? [1]
# 
# 
# 
# By default, each time the CPAN module is started, cache scanning is
# performed to keep the cache size in sync. To prevent this, answer
# 'never'.
# 
# Perform cache scanning (atstart or never)? [atstart]
# 
# 
# 
# To considerably speed up the initial CPAN shell startup, it is
# possible to use Storable to create a cache of metadata. If Storable
# is not available, the normal index mechanism will be used.
# 
# Note: this mechanism is not used when use_sqlite is on and SQLLite is
# running.
# 
# Cache metadata (yes/no)? [yes]
# 
# 
# 
# CPAN::SQLite is a layer between the index files that are downloaded
# from the CPAN and CPAN.pm that speeds up metadata queries and reduces
# memory consumption of CPAN.pm considereably.
# 
# Use CPAN::SQLite if available? (yes/no)? [no]
# 
# 
# 
# The CPAN module can detect when a module which you are trying to build
# depends on prerequisites. If this happens, it can build the
# prerequisites for you automatically ('follow'), ask you for
# confirmation ('ask'), or just ignore them ('ignore'). Please set your
# policy to one of the three values.
# 
# Policy on building prerequisites (follow, ask or ignore)? [follow]
# 
# 
# 
# When a module declares another one as a 'build_requires' prerequisite
# this means that the other module is only needed for building or
# testing the module but need not be installed permanently. In this case
# you may wish to install that other module nonetheless or just keep it
# in the 'build_dir' directory to have it available only temporarily.
# Installing saves time on future installations but makes the perl
# installation bigger.
# 
# You can choose if you want to always install (yes), never install (no)
# or be always asked. In the latter case you can set the default answer
# for the question to yes (ask/yes) or no (ask/no).
# 
# Policy on installing 'build_requires' modules (yes, no, ask/yes,
# ask/no)? [ask/yes]
# 
# 
# 
# CPAN packages can be digitally signed by authors and thus verified
# with the security provided by strong cryptography. The exact mechanism
# is defined in the Module::Signature module. While this is generally
# considered a good thing, it is not always convenient to the end user
# to install modules that are signed incorrectly or where the key of the
# author is not available or where some prerequisite for
# Module::Signature has a bug and so on.
# 
# With the check_sigs parameter you can turn signature checking on and
# off. The default is off for now because the whole tool chain for the
# functionality is not yet considered mature by some. The author of
# CPAN.pm would recommend setting it to true most of the time and
# turning it off only if it turns out to be annoying.
# 
# Note that if you do not have Module::Signature installed, no signature
# checks will be performed at all.
# 
# Always try to check and verify signatures if a SIGNATURE file is in the package
# and Module::Signature is installed (yes/no)? [no]
# 
# 
# 
# The goal of the CPAN Testers project (http://testers.cpan.org/) is to
# test as many CPAN packages as possible on as many platforms as
# possible.  This provides valuable feedback to module authors and
# potential users to identify bugs or platform compatibility issues and
# improves the overall quality and value of CPAN.
# 
# One way you can contribute is to send test results for each module
# that you install.  If you install the CPAN::Reporter module, you have
# the option to automatically generate and email test reports to CPAN
# Testers whenever you run tests on a CPAN package.
# 
# See the CPAN::Reporter documentation for additional details and
# configuration settings.  If your firewall blocks outgoing email,
# you will need to configure CPAN::Reporter before sending reports.
# 
# Email test reports if CPAN::Reporter is installed (yes/no)? [no]
# 
# 
# 
# At the time of this writing there are two competing YAML modules,
# YAML.pm and YAML::Syck. The latter is faster but needs a C compiler
# installed on your system. There may be more alternative YAML
# conforming modules but at the time of writing a potential third
# player, YAML::Tiny, seemed not powerful enough to work with CPAN.pm.
# 
# Which YAML implementation would you prefer? [YAML]
# 
# CPAN: YAML loaded ok (v0.62)

# The CPAN module will need a few external programs to work properly.

# Sometimes you may wish to leave the processes run by CPAN alone
# without caring about them. Because the Makefile.PL or the Build.PL
# sometimes contains question you're expected to answer, you can set a

# 
# If you set this value to 0, these processes will wait forever. This is

# If you're accessing the net via proxies, you can specify them in the

# Shall we always set FTP_PASSIVE envariable when dealing with ftp

# 
# 
# 
# CPAN.pm changes the current working directory often and needs to
# determine its own current working directory. Per default it uses
# Cwd::cwd but if this doesn't work on your system for some reason,
# alternatives can be configured according to the following table:
# 
#     cwd         Cwd::cwd
#     getcwd      Cwd::getcwd
#     fastcwd     Cwd::fastcwd
#     backtickcwd external command cwd
# 
# Preferred method for determining the current working directory? [cwd]
# 
# 
# 
# The prompt of the cpan shell can contain the current command number
# for easier tracking of the session or be a plain string. Do you want
# the command number in the prompt (yes/no)? [yes]
# 
# 
# 
# When using Term::ReadLine, you can turn ornaments on so that your
# input stands out against the output from CPAN.pm. Do you want to turn
# ornaments on? [no]
# 
# 
# 
# When you have Term::ANSIColor installed, you can turn on colorized
# output to have some visual differences between normal CPAN.pm output,
# warnings, debugging output, and the output of the modules being
# installed. Set your favorite colors after some experimenting with the
# Term::ANSIColor module. Do you want to turn on colored output? [no]
# 
# Your terminal expects ISO-8859-1 (yes/no)?
# 
# The next option deals with the charset (aka character set) your
# terminal supports. In general, CPAN is English speaking territory, so
# the charset does not matter much, but some of the aliens out there who
# upload their software to CPAN bear names that are outside the ASCII
# range. If your terminal supports UTF-8, you should say no to the next
# question.  If it supports ISO-8859-1 (also known as LATIN1) then you
# should say yes.  If it supports neither, your answer does not matter
# because you will not be able to read the names of some authors
# anyway. If you answer no, names will be output in UTF-8.
# 
# Your terminal expects ISO-8859-1 (yes/no)? [no]
# 
# 
# 
# If you have one of the readline packages (Term::ReadLine::Perl,
# Term::ReadLine::Gnu, possibly others) installed, the interactive CPAN
# shell will have history support. The next two questions deal with the
# filename of the history file and with its size. If you do not want to
# set this variable, please hit SPACE RETURN to the following question.
# 
# File to save your history? [/home/hwadm/.cpan/build/CPAN-1.9101-SW7TPG/t/dot-cpan/histfile]
#

# 
# The 'd' and the 'm' command normally only show you information they
# have in their in-memory database and thus will never connect to the
# internet. If you set the 'show_upload_date' variable to true, 'm' and
# 'd' will additionally show you the upload date of the module or
# distribution. Per default this feature is off because it may require a
# net connection to get at the upload date.
# 
# Always try to show upload date with 'd' and 'm' command (yes/no)? [no]
