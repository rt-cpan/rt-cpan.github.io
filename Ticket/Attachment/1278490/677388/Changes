Revision history for Perl module App::ZofCMS

0.0223  2013-10-22
    1) Fixed inconsistent versions (for CPANTS Game)
    2) Made zofcms_helper NOT overwrite existing plugin files,
       when --plugins option is used.
       The new option --overwrite_existing_plugins=1 can be used
       to elicit plugin overwrite
    3) Added use strict/warnings and plugins => [] to the
       default file made by --pages option in the zofcms_helper.
    4) Removed use_ok('Carp') test as it was throwing warnings.
       Carp is core anyway, so the test is somewhat useless.
