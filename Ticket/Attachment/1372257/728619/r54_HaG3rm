long\ line=Text::Wrap::wrap()" has a number of variables that control its \
    behav- ior.  Because other modules might be using "Text::Wrap::wrap()" \
    it is suggested that you leave these variables alone!  If you can't do \
    that, then use "local($Text::Wrap::VARIABLE) = YOURVALUE" when you \
    change the values so that the original value is restored.  This \
    "local()" trick will not work if you import the variable into your own \
    namespace.
