Subject: medical labs in our health insurance network
Date: Mon, 21 Mar 2005 16:46:12 -0800

Aetna's web site says this lab is in Aetna's network:

Group Name:  Labcorp of America Holdings
Type of Service: Independent Lab
Address: 310 Santa Fe Drive, Suite 104, Encinitas, CA 92024
Phone Number(s): (760) 753-9359

This is the same building as Dr. Kim.

I called Labcorp and asked if that suite number is correct and they said
yes.  They told me there is a different lab called Scripps lab on the third
floor.  I did not see Scripps lab in Aetna's network.  I used to go to
Scripps lab.  It looks like I will have to switch to Labcorp.

In case you have not already gone to any of the labs, I wanted to pass
along this advice that Labcorp is probably the better choice.

In case you have already gone, I wanted to know which one you went to
and whether Aetna paid the claim with in-network benefits.
