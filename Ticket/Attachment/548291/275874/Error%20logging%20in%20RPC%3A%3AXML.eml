Hi Randy,

I was getting errors like this in my logs:

    Jul 29 15:48:16 [ERROR] "Failed XMLRPC parsing:
    mismatched tag at line 1, column 597, byte 597
    mismatched tag at line 1, column 615, byte 597

But no context.  I'm parsing on-the-fly so I don't really have easy
access to the XML to print it out.

But, it seems if this is added to the parser creation:

    ErrorContext => 1

Then I get much nicer output:

    mismatched tag at line 1, column 44, byte 44:
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><hi></lo>
    ===========================================^

Think that would be a good default?
