

PLEASE NOTE:

For 'make test' to run properly, you must ensure that the
database user '' can connect to your MySQL server
and has the proper privileges that these tests require such
as 'drop table', 'create table', 'drop procedure', 'create procedure'
as well as others.

mysql> grant all privileges on test.* to ''@'localhost' identified by 's3kr1t';

You can also optionally set the user to run 'make test' with:

perl Makefile.PL --testuser=username

I will use the following settings for compiling and testing:

  cflags        (mysql_config) = "-IC:\soft\mariadb/include/mysql"
  embedded      (mysql_config) = 
  ldflags       (guessed     ) = 
  libs          (mysql_config) = "C:\soft\mariadb/lib/mysqlclient.lib" "wsock32.lib" "advapi32.lib" "user32.lib"
  mysql_config  (guessed     ) = mysql_config
  nocatchstderr (default     ) = 0
  nofoundrows   (default     ) = 0
  nossl         (default     ) = 0
  testdb        (default     ) = test
  testhost      (default     ) = 
  testpassword  (default     ) = 
  testport      (default     ) = 
  testsocket    (default     ) = 
  testuser      (guessed     ) = 

To change these settings, see 'perl Makefile.PL --help' and
'perldoc DBD::mysql::INSTALL'.

Checking if your kit is complete...
Looks good
Have \soft\perl\lib
Want \soft\perl-5~2.0\lib
Your perl and your Config.pm seem to have different ideas about the
architecture they are running on.
Perl thinks: [lib]
Config says: [MSWin32-x64-multi-thread]
This may or may not cause problems. Please check your installation of perl
if you have problems building this extension.
