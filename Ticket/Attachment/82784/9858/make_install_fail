This script will prompt you to enter hostnames that can be used as
defaults for some of the modules in the libnet distribution.

To ensure that you do not enter an invalid hostname, I can perform a
lookup on each hostname you enter. If your internet connection is via
a dialup line then you may not want me to perform these lookups, as
it will require you to be on-line.

Do you want me to perform hostname lookups (y|n) ? [yes]

The following questions all require a list of host names, separated
with spaces. If you do not have a host available for any of the
services, then enter a single space, followed by <CR>. To accept the
default, hit <CR>

Enter a list of available NNTP hosts : []
Enter a list of available SMTP hosts : []
Enter a list of available POP3 hosts : []
Enter a list of available SNPP hosts : []
Enter a list of available PH Hosts   : []
Enter a list of available TIME Hosts   : []
Enter a list of available DAYTIME Hosts   : []

Do you have a firewall/ftp proxy  between your machine and the internet

If you use a SOCKS firewall answer no

(y|n) ? [no]

Normally when FTP needs a data connection the client tells the server
a port to connect to, and the server initiates a connection to the client.

Some setups, in particular firewall setups, can/do not work using this
protocol. In these situations the client must make the connection to the
server, this is called a passive transfer.

Should all FTP connections be passive (y|n) ? [no]

What is your local internet domain name : [] cnt.com

If you specified some default hosts above, it is possible for me to
do some basic tests when you run `make test'

This will cause `make test' to be quite a bit slower and, if your
internet connection is via dialup, will require you to be on-line
unless the hosts are local.

Do you want me to run these tests (y|n) ? [yes] no
