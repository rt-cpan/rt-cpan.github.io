gcc [<B>-c</B>|<B>-S</B>|<B>-E</B>] [<B>-std=</B><I>standard</I>]

<P>

Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  <B>g++</B> accepts mostly the same options as <B>gcc</B>.
<P>

In Apple's version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>, both <B>cc</B> and <B>gcc</B> are actually
symbolic links to a compiler named like gcc-<I>version</I>.
Similarly, <B>c++</B> and <B>g++</B> are links to a compiler named like
g++-<I>version</I>.
<P>

Note that Apple's <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> includes a number of extensions to standard <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
(flagged below with ``<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>''), and that not all generic <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
options are available or supported on Darwin / Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X.  In particular,
Apple does not currently support the compilation of Fortran, Ada, or
Java, although there are third parties who have made these work.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
When you invoke <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The ``overall options'' allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <B>-c</B> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
<P>

Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
<P>

Most of the command line options that you can use with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
<P>

The <B>gcc</B> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <I>not</I> be grouped: <B>-dr</B> is very different from <B>-d&nbsp;-r</B>.
<P>

You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify <B>-L</B> more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.
<P>

Many options have long names starting with <B>-f</B> or with
<B>-W</B>---for example, 
<B>-fmove-loop-invariants</B>, <B>-Wformat</B> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<B>-ffoo</B> would be <B>-fno-foo</B>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

<H2>Options Controlling the Kind of Output</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
<P>

For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

<DT><B>-x none</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACF"></A>
Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are

has not been used at all).
<DT><B>-ObjC</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACG"></A>

<DT><B>-arch</B> <I>arch</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixACI"></A>
Compile for the specified target architecture <I>arch</I>.  The
allowable values are <B>i386</B>, <B>x86_64</B>, <B>ppc</B> and
<B>ppc64</B>.  Multiple options work, and direct the compiler to
produce ``universal'' binaries including object code for each
architecture specified with <B>-arch</B>.  This option only works if
assembler and libraries are available for each architecture specified.
(<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-Xarch_</B><I>arch</I><B> </B><I>option</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixACJ"></A>
Apply <I>option</I> to the command line for architecture <I>arch</I>.
This is useful for specifying an option that should only apply to
one architecture when building a ``universal'' binary.  (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-fsave-repository=</B><I>file</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixACK"></A>
Save debug info in separate object file.
This is available only while building <FONT SIZE="-1">PCH</FONT> in -gfull mode.
<DT><B>-pass-exit-codes</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACL"></A>
Normally the <B>gcc</B> program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<B>-pass-exit-codes</B>, the <B>gcc</B> program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.  The C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, and Fortran frontends return 4, if an internal
compiler error is encountered.
</DL>
<P>

If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<B>-x</B> (or filename suffixes) to tell <B>gcc</B> where to start, and
one of the options <B>-c</B>, <B>-S</B>, or <B>-E</B> to say where
<B>gcc</B> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<B>-x cpp-output -E</B>) instruct <B>gcc</B> to do nothing at all.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACM"></A>
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.


<P>


By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <B>.c</B>, <B>.i</B>, <B>.s</B>, etc., with <B>.o</B>.


<P>


Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
<DT><B>-S</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACN"></A>
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.


<P>


By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <B>.c</B>, <B>.i</B>, etc., with <B>.s</B>.


<P>


Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
<DT><B>-E</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACO"></A>
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.


<P>


Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.
<DT><B>-o</B> <I>file</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixACP"></A>
Place output in file <I>file</I>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.


<P>


If <B>-o</B> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in <I>a.out</I>, the object file for
<I>source.suffix</I> in <I>source.o</I>, its
assembler file in <I>source.s</I>, a precompiled header file in
<I>source.suffix.gch</I>, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACQ"></A>
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
<DT><B>-###</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACR"></A>
Like <B>-v</B> except the commands are not executed and all command
arguments are quoted.  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the
driver-generated command lines.
<DT><B>-pipe</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACS"></A>
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> assembler has
no trouble.
<DT><B>-combine</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACT"></A>
If you are compiling multiple source files, this option tells the driver
to pass all the source files to the compiler at once (for those
languages for which the compiler can handle this).  This will allow
intermodule analysis (<FONT SIZE="-1">IMA</FONT>) to be performed by the compiler.  Currently the only
language for which this is supported is C.  If you pass source files for
multiple languages to the driver, using this option, the driver will invoke
the compiler(s) that support <FONT SIZE="-1">IMA</FONT> once each, passing each compiler all the
source files appropriate for it.  For those languages that do not support
<FONT SIZE="-1">IMA</FONT> this option will be ignored, and the compiler will be invoked once for
each source file in that language.  If you use this option in conjunction
with <B>-save-temps</B>, the compiler will generate multiple
pre-processed files
(one for each source file), but only one (combined) <I>.o</I> or
<I>.s</I> file.
<DT><B>--help</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACU"></A>
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by <B>gcc</B>.  If the <B>-v</B> option is also specified
then <B>--help</B> will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by <B>gcc</B>, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the <B>-Wextra</B> option is also specified then command
line options which have no documentation associated with them will also
be displayed.
<DT><B>--target-help</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACV"></A>
Print (on the standard output) a description of target specific command
line options for each tool.
<DT><B>--version</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACW"></A>
Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.
<DT><B>@</B><I>file</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixACX"></A>
Read command-line options from <I>file</I>.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @<I>file</I> option.  If <I>file</I>
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.


<P>


Options in <I>file</I> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The <I>file</I> may itself contain additional
@<I>file</I> options; any such options will be processed recursively.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Programs</H2>

<A NAME="ixACY"></A>
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <B>.C</B>,
<B>.cc</B>, <B>.cpp</B>, <B>.CPP</B>, <B>.c++</B>, <B>.cp</B>, or
<B>.cxx</B>; C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> header files often use <B>.hh</B> or <B>.H</B>; and
preprocessed C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> files use the suffix <B>.ii</B>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name <B>gcc</B>).
<P>

However, the use of <B>gcc</B> does not add the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.
<B>g++</B> is a program that calls <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> and treats <B>.c</B>,
<B>.h</B> and <B>.i</B> files as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> source files instead of C source
files unless <B>-x</B> is used, and automatically specifies linking
against the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a <B>.h</B> extension for use in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
compilations.  On many systems, <B>g++</B> is also installed with
the name <B>c++</B>.
<P>

When you compile C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options Controlling C Dialect</H2>

<A NAME="ixACZ"></A>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>) that the compiler
accepts:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-ansi</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADA"></A>
In C mode, support all <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90 programs.  In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> mode,
remove <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions that conflict with <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


This turns off certain features of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> that are incompatible with <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT>
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> (when compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> code),
such as the <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <TT>&quot;unix&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;vax&quot;</TT> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> style <B>//</B> comments as well as
the <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> keyword.


<P>


The alternate keywords <TT>&quot;__asm__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__extension__&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;__inline__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT> continue to work despite
<B>-ansi</B>.  You would not want to use them in an <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <B>-ansi</B>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <TT>&quot;__unix__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__vax__&quot;</TT> are also available, with or
without <B>-ansi</B>.


<P>


The <B>-ansi</B> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <B>-pedantic</B> is required in
addition to <B>-ansi</B>.


<P>


The macro <TT>&quot;__STRICT_ANSI__&quot;</TT> is predefined when the <B>-ansi</B>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.


<P>


Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C (such as <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;ffs&quot;</TT>) are not built-in
functions with <B>-ansi</B> is used.

<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99 plus <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions.  When <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99 is fully implemented in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>,
this will become the default.  The name <B>gnu9x</B> is deprecated.

<P>


Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the
features of newer standards in so far as they do not conflict with
previous C standards.  For example, you may use <TT>&quot;__restrict__&quot;</TT> even
when <B>-std=c99</B> is not specified.


<P>


The <B>-std</B> options specifying some version of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C have the same
effects as <B>-ansi</B>, except that features that were not in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90
but are in the specified version (for example, <B>//</B> comments and
the <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> keyword in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99) are not disabled.
</DL>

<DT><B>-fgnu89-inline</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADO"></A>
The option <B>-fgnu89-inline</B> tells <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use the traditional
<FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> semantics for <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> functions when in C99 mode.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using&nbsp;this
option is roughly equivalent to adding the <TT>&quot;gnu_inline&quot;</TT> function
attribute to all inline functions.


<P>


This option is accepted by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> versions 4.1.3 and up.  In <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> versions
/* <FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">LOCAL</FONT> extern inline */
prior to 4.3 (4.2 for Apple's gcc), C99 inline semantics are not supported, and thus this
option is effectively assumed to be present regardless of whether or not
it is specified; the only effect of specifying it explicitly is to
disable warnings about using inline functions in C99 mode.  Likewise,
the option <B>-fno-gnu89-inline</B> is not supported in versions of
/* <FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">LOCAL</FONT> extern inline */
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> before 4.3 (4.2 for Apple's gcc).  It is supported only in C99 or gnu99 mode, not in
C89 or gnu89 mode.


<P>


The preprocesor macros <TT>&quot;__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__&quot;</TT> may be used to check which semantics are
in effect for <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> functions.
<DT><B>-aux-info</B> <I>filename</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixADP"></A>
Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.


<P>


Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<B>I</B>, <B>N</B> for new or
<B>O</B> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (<B>C</B> or <B>F</B>, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.
<DT><B>-faltivec</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADQ"></A>
This flag is provided for compatibility with Metrowerks CodeWarrior and MrC
compilers as well as previous Apple versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.  It causes the
<B>-mpim-altivec</B> option to be turned on.
<DT><B>-fasm-blocks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADR"></A>
Enable the use of blocks and entire functions of assembly code within
a C or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> file.  The syntax follows that used in CodeWarrior.  This
option is not supported for <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> targets.  (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-fno-asm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADS"></A>
Do not recognize <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <TT>&quot;__asm__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__inline__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT>
instead.  <B>-ansi</B> implies <B>-fno-asm</B>.


<P>


In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, this switch only affects the <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keyword, since
<TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <B>-fno-gnu-keywords</B> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<B>-std=c99</B> or <B>-std=gnu99</B>), this
switch only affects the <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keywords, since
<TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> is a standard keyword in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99.
<DT><B>-fno-blocks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADT"></A>
Disable the use of blocks.  In <B>-std=c99</B> mode, blocks are
turned off by default.  <B>-fblocks</B> can be used to re-enable the
feature, if off.  Runtime support for blocks first appeared in Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT>
X 10.6.  When targeting 10.6 (see <B>-mmacosx-version-min</B>) and
later, the extension is on by default.
<DT><B>-fno-builtin</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADU"></A>

<DT><B>-fno-builtin-</B><I>function</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixADV"></A>

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
<B>__builtin_</B> as prefix.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with <B>-Wformat</B> for bad calls to
<TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT>, when <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> is built in, and <TT>&quot;strlen&quot;</TT> is
known not to modify global memory.


<P>


With the <B>-fno-builtin-</B><I>function</I> option
only the built-in function <I>function</I> is
disabled.  <I>function</I> must not begin with <B>__builtin_</B>.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<B>-fbuiltin-</B><I>function</I> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <B>-fno-builtin</B> or
<B>-ffreestanding</B>, you may define macros such as:


<P>




<PRE>
        #define <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?n+abs">abs</A>(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
        #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))

</PRE>


<DT><B>-fhosted</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADW"></A>
Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
<B>-fbuiltin</B>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> has a return
type of <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to <B>-fno-freestanding</B>.
<DT><B>-ffreestanding</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADX"></A>
Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies <B>-fno-builtin</B>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>.  The most obvious example is an <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> kernel.
This is equivalent to <B>-fno-hosted</B>.
<DT><B>-fopenmp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADY"></A>
Enable handling of OpenMP directives <TT>&quot;#pragma omp&quot;</TT> in C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and
<TT>&quot;!$omp&quot;</TT> in Fortran.  When <B>-fopenmp</B> is specified, the
compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v2.5 &lt;<B><A HREF="http://www.openmp.org/">http://www.openmp.org/</A></B>&gt;.
<DT><B>-fms-extensions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADZ"></A>
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.


<P>


Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
accepted with this option.
<DT><B>-trigraphs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEA"></A>
Support <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C trigraphs.  The <B>-ansi</B> option (and <B>-std</B>
options for strict <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C conformance) implies <B>-trigraphs</B>.
<DT><B>-no-integrated-cpp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEB"></A>
Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.  This
option allows a user supplied ``cc1'', ``cc1plus'', or ``cc1obj'' via the
<B>-B</B> option.  The user supplied compilation step can then add in
an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before
compiling.  The default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)


<P>


The semantics of this option will change if ``cc1'', ``cc1plus'', and
``cc1obj'' are merged.
<DT><B>-traditional</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEC"></A>

<DT><B>-traditional-cpp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAED"></A>

Formerly, these options caused <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to attempt to emulate a pre-standard
C compiler.  They are now only supported with the <B>-E</B> switch.
The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.  See the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> manual for details.
<DT><B>-fcond-mismatch</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEE"></A>
Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT><B>-fno-nested-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEF"></A>
Disable nested functions.  This option is not supported for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> or
Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.  On Darwin, nested functions are disabled by default.
<DT><B>-fpch-preprocess</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEG"></A>
Enable <FONT SIZE="-1">PCH</FONT> processing even when <B>-E</B> or <B>-save-temps</B> is used.
<DT><B>-fnon-lvalue-assign</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEH"></A>
C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> forbid the use of casts and conditional expressions as lvalues, e.g.:


<P>




<PRE>
        float *p, q, r;
        ((int *)p)++;
        (cond ? q : r) = 3.0;

</PRE>




<P>


As a transitional measure, the Apple version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> 4.0 allows casts and 
conditional expressions to be used as lvalues in certain situations.  This
is accomplished via the <B>-fnon-lvalue-assign</B> switch, which is on
by default.  Whenever an lvalue cast or an lvalue conditional expression is
encountered, the compiler will issue a deprecation warning and then rewrite
the expression as follows:


<P>




<PRE>
        (type)expr                ---becomes---&gt;      *(type *)&amp;expr
        cond ? expr1 : expr2      ---becomes---&gt;      *(cond ? &amp;expr1 : &amp;expr2)

</PRE>




<P>


To disallow lvalue casts and lvalue conditional expressions altogether, 
specify <B>-fno-non-lvalue-assign</B>; lvalue casts and lvalue conditional
expressions will be disallowed in future versions of Apple's <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.
<DT><B>-flax-vector-conversions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEI"></A>
Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of
elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should not be
used for new code.
<DT><B>-funsigned-char</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEJ"></A>
Let the type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> be unsigned, like <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Each kind of machine has a default for what <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> should
be.  It is either like <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT> by default or like
<TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> by default.


<P>


Ideally, a portable program should always use <TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.


<P>


The type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> is always a distinct type from each of
<TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
<DT><B>-fsigned-char</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEK"></A>
Let the type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> be signed, like <TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Note that this is equivalent to <B>-fno-unsigned-char</B>, which is
the negative form of <B>-funsigned-char</B>.  Likewise, the option
<B>-fno-signed-char</B> is equivalent to <B>-funsigned-char</B>.
<DT><B>-fsigned-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEL"></A>

<DT><B>-funsigned-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEM"></A>
<DT><B>-fno-signed-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEN"></A>
<DT><B>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEO"></A>

These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <TT>&quot;signed&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;unsigned&quot;</TT>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> are signed types.
<DT><B>-fconstant-cfstrings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEP"></A>
Enable the automatic creation of a CoreFoundation-type constant string
whenever a special builtin <TT>&quot;__builtin__CFStringMakeConstantString&quot;</TT>
is called on a literal string.  (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-Wnonportable-cfstrings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEQ"></A>
Warn if constant CFString objects contain non-portable characters 
(default behavior)
<DT><B>-fglobal-alloc-prefer-bytes</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAER"></A>

<DT><B>-fno-global-alloc-prefer-bytes</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAES"></A>

For the x86_32 architecture, prefer byte or short values to word
values during global register allocation.  Some of the registers on
this target can't be used with values smaller than a 32-bit word;
allocating these values earlier increases the chance they will get a
byte-capable (or short-capable) register.  Ignored for other targets.
Defaults on with global register allocation (<TT>&quot;-Os&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;-O2&quot;</TT>,
or <TT>&quot;-O3&quot;</TT>).  (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-fwritable-strings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAET"></A>
Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize
them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which assume they can
write into string constants.


<P>


Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; ``constants'' should
be constant.


<P>


This option is deprecated.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options Controlling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialect</H2>

<A NAME="ixAEU"></A>
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs; but you can also use most of the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <TT>&quot;firstClass.C&quot;</TT> like this:
<P>



<PRE>
        g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C

</PRE>


<P>

In this example, only <B>-frepo</B> is an option meant
only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.
<P>

Here is a list of options that are <I>only</I> for compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fabi-version=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEV"></A>
Use version <I>n</I> of the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>.  Version 2 is the version of the
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> that first appeared in G++ 3.4.  Version 1 is the version of
the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be
the version that conforms most closely to the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> specification.
Therefore, the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> obtained using version 0 will change as <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> bugs
are fixed.


<P>


The default is version 2.
<DT><B>-fno-access-control</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEW"></A>
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
<DT><B>-fcheck-new</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEX"></A>
Check that the pointer returned by <TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard specifies that
<TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> will only return <TT>0</TT> if it is declared
<B></B>throw()<B></B>, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <TT>&quot;std::bad_alloc&quot;</TT>.  See also
<B>new (nothrow)</B>.
<DT><B>-fconserve-space</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEY"></A>
Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after <TT>&quot;main()&quot;</TT> has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.


<P>


This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> without making them common.
<DT><B>-ffriend-injection</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEZ"></A>
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> a friend function which is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.


<P>


This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.
<DT><B>-fno-elide-constructors</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFA"></A>
The C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
<DT><B>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFB"></A>
Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at runtime.  This option violates the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>NDEBUG</B></FONT><B></B>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
will still optimize based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception will result in undefined behavior.
<DT><B>-ffor-scope</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFC"></A>

<DT><B>-fno-for-scope</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFD"></A>

If <B>-ffor-scope</B> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <I>for-init-statement</I> is limited to the <B>for</B> loop itself,
as specified by the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard.
If <B>-fno-for-scope</B> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <I>for-init-statement</I> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
<DT><B>-fno-gnu-keywords</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFE"></A>
Do not recognize <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT> instead.
<B>-ansi</B> implies <B>-fno-gnu-keywords</B>.
<DT><B>-fno-implicit-templates</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFF"></A>
Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
<DT><B>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFG"></A>
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.
<DT><B>-fno-implement-inlines</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFH"></A>
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <B>#pragma implementation</B>.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
<DT><B>-fms-extensions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFI"></A>
Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in <FONT SIZE="-1">MFC</FONT>, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.
<DT><B>-fno-nonansi-builtins</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFJ"></A>
Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
<FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI/ISO</FONT> C.  These include <TT>&quot;ffs&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;_exit&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;index&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bzero&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;conjf&quot;</TT>, and other related functions.
<DT><B>-fno-operator-names</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFK"></A>
Do not treat the operator name keywords <TT>&quot;and&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bitand&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;bitor&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;compl&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;not&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;or&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;xor&quot;</TT> as
synonyms as keywords.
<DT><B>-fno-optional-diags</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFL"></A>
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
<DT><B>-fpermissive</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFM"></A>
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <B>-fpermissive</B> will allow some
nonconforming code to compile.
<DT><B>-frepo</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFN"></A>
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <B>-fno-implicit-templates</B>.
<DT><B>-fno-rtti</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFO"></A>
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> runtime type identification features
(<B>dynamic_cast</B> and <B>typeid</B>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed. The <B>dynamic_cast</B> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require runtime type information, i.e. casts to <TT>&quot;void *&quot;</TT> or to
unambiguous base classes.
<DT><B>-fstats</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFP"></A>
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
<DT><B>-ftemplate-depth-</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFQ"></A>
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <I>n</I>.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  <FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI/ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.
<DT><B>-fno-threadsafe-statics</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFR"></A>
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.
<DT><B>-fuse-cxa-atexit</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFS"></A>
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<TT>&quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;</TT> function rather than the <TT>&quot;atexit&quot;</TT> function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
<TT>&quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFT"></A>
Don't use the <TT>&quot;__cxa_get_exception_ptr&quot;</TT> runtime routine.  This
will cause <TT>&quot;std::uncaught_exception&quot;</TT> to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
<DT><B>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFU"></A>
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline methods where the addresses of the two functions
were taken in different shared objects.


<P>


The effect of this is that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<TT>&quot;__attribute__ ((visibility (&quot;hidden&quot;)))&quot;</TT> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO</FONT> and do not require a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> indirection
when used within the <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO</FONT>.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO</FONT> as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.


<P>


The behaviour of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.


<P>


You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility will have no effect.


<P>


Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
<DT><B>-fvisibility-ms-compat</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFV"></A>
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.


<P>


The flag makes these changes to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s linkage model:


<P>


1. It sets the default visibility to 'hidden', like 
<B>-fvisibility=hidden</B>.
2. Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
3. The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications which are defined in more than one different
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they would have
been permitted when this option was not used.


<P>


This option is discouraged, rather, it is preferable for types to be
explicitly exported as desired on a per-class basis.  Unfortunately
because Visual Studio can't compare two different hidden types as
unequal for the purposes of type_info and exception handling, users
are able to write code that relies upon this behavior.


<P>


Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects will be different, so changing one will not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects will not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ODR</FONT> to define types with the same name differently.
<DT><B>-fno-weak</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFW"></A>
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
<DT><B>-nostdinc++</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFX"></A>
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.)
</DL>
<P>

In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fno-default-inline</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFY"></A>
Do not assume <B>inline</B> for functions defined inside a class scope.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.
<DT><B>-Wabi</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAFZ"></A>
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.


<P>


You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.


<P>


The known incompatibilities at this point include:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
        struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };

</PRE>




<P>


In this case, G++ will place <TT>&quot;B::f2&quot;</TT> into the same byte
as<TT>&quot;A::f1&quot;</TT>; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT> identically.
<DT>*<DD>
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
        struct B { B(); char c2; };
        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};

</PRE>




<P>


In this case, G++ will not place <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT> into the tail-padding for
<TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT>; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout <TT>&quot;C&quot;</TT> identically.
<DT>*<DD>
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:


<P>




<PRE>
        union U { int i : 4096; };

</PRE>




<P>


Assuming that an <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A {};
        
        struct B {
          A a;
          virtual void f ();
        };
        
        struct C : public B, public A {};

</PRE>




<P>


G++ will place the <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> base class of <TT>&quot;C&quot;</TT> at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
<TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> data member of <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT> is already at offset zero.
<DT>*<DD>
Names of template functions whose types involve <TT>&quot;typename&quot;</TT> or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.


<P>




<PRE>
        template &lt;typename Q&gt;
        void f(typename Q::X) {}
        
        template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class Q&gt;
        void f(typename Q&lt;int&gt;::X) {}

Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-null-sentinel</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGF"></A>
Warn also about the use of an uncasted <TT>&quot;NULL&quot;</TT> as sentinel.  When
compiling only with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> this is a valid sentinel, as <TT>&quot;NULL&quot;</TT> is defined
to <TT>&quot;__null&quot;</TT>.  Although it is a null pointer constant not a null pointer,
it is guaranteed to of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is
not portable across different compilers.
<DT><B>-Wno-non-template-friend</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGG"></A>
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
<B>friend foo(int)</B>), the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, <B>-Wnon-template-friend</B> allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
<B>-Wno-non-template-friend</B> which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.
<DT><B>-Wold-style-cast</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGH"></A>
Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within

<B>static_cast</B>, <B>reinterpret_cast</B>, and <B>const_cast</B>) are
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.
<DT><B>-Woverloaded-virtual</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGI"></A>
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:

        };
        
        struct B: public A {
          void f(int);
        };

</PRE>




<P>


the <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> class version of <TT>&quot;f&quot;</TT> is hidden in <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT>, and code
like:


<P>




<PRE>
        B* b;
        b-&gt;f();

will fail to compile.
<DT><B>-Wno-pmf-conversions</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>

<DT><B>-Wsign-promo</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGK"></A>
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A {
          operator int ();
          A&amp; operator = (int);

          A a,b;
          a = b;
        }

In this example, G++ will synthesize a default <B>A&amp; operator =

<P>

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs, but you can also use most of
the language-independent <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file <TT>&quot;some_class.m&quot;</TT> like this:
<P>



<PRE>
        gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m

</PRE>


<P>

In this example, <B>-fgnu-runtime</B> is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.
<P>

Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
<B>-Wtraditional</B>).  Similarly, Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> compilations may use
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>-specific options (e.g., <B>-Wabi</B>).
<P>

Here is a list of options that are <I>only</I> for compiling Objective-C

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fconstant-string-class=</B><I>class-name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGM"></A>
Use <I>class-name</I> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax <TT>&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT>.  The default
class name is <TT>&quot;NXConstantString&quot;</TT> if the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> runtime is being used, and
<TT>&quot;NSConstantString&quot;</TT> if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
<B>-fconstant-cfstrings</B> option, if also present, will override the
<B>-fconstant-string-class</B> setting and cause <TT>&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT> literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
<DT><B>-fgnu-runtime</B><DD>

<A NAME="ixAGO"></A>
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X.  The macro
<TT>&quot;__NEXT_RUNTIME__&quot;</TT> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
<DT><B>-fno-nil-receivers</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGP"></A>
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g.,
<TT>&quot;[receiver message:arg]&quot;</TT>) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
is not <TT>&quot;nil&quot;</TT>.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime
to be used.  Currently, this option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X 10.3 and later.
<DT><B>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGQ"></A>
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special <TT>&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot;</TT> instance method that will run
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return <TT>&quot;self&quot;</TT>.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special <TT>&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;</TT> method that will run
all such default destructors, in reverse order.


<P>


The <TT>&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot;</TT> and/or <TT>&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;</TT> methods
thusly generated will only operate on instance variables declared in the
current Objective-C class, and not those inherited from superclasses.  It
is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods
in an object's inheritance hierarchy.  The <TT>&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot;</TT> methods
will be invoked by the runtime immediately after a new object
instance is allocated; the <TT>&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;</TT> methods will
be invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an object instance.


<P>


As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the <TT>&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;</TT> methods.

<P>


The <TT>@throw</TT> statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> program; when used inside of a <TT>@catch</TT> block, the
<TT>@throw</TT> may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the <TT>@catch</TT> will be rethrown.


<P>


Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest <TT>@catch</TT> clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how <TT>&quot;catch&quot;</TT> blocks work in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Java.  A
<TT>&quot;@catch(id ...)&quot;</TT> clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch
any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous <TT>@catch</TT>
clauses (if any).


<P>


The <TT>@finally</TT> clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding <TT>&quot;@try ... @catch&quot;</TT> section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the <TT>&quot;@try ... @catch&quot;</TT> section, analogously to the behavior
of the <TT>&quot;finally&quot;</TT> clause in Java.


<P>


There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Although currently designed to be binary compatible with <TT>&quot;NS_HANDLER&quot;</TT>-style
idioms provided by the <TT>&quot;NSException&quot;</TT> class, the new
exceptions can only be used on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X 10.3 (Panther) and later
systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C
runtime.
<DT>*<DD>
As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot <TT>@throw</TT> an exception
from Objective-C and <TT>&quot;catch&quot;</TT> it in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, or vice versa
(i.e., <TT>&quot;throw ... @catch&quot;</TT>).
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


The <B>-fobjc-sjlj-exceptions</B> switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:


<P>




<PRE>
          @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
            ...
          }

</PRE>




<P>


Upon entering the <TT>@synchronized</TT> block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding <TT>&quot;guard&quot;</TT>
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait until
the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once <TT>&quot;guard&quot;</TT> becomes available,
the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in
the <TT>@synchronized</TT> block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby
making <TT>&quot;guard&quot;</TT> available to other threads).


<P>


Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
<TT>@synchronized</TT>.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
<TT>@synchronized</TT> blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object
to be unlocked properly.
</DL>

<DT><B>-fobjc-gc</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGT"></A>
Enable garbage collection (<FONT SIZE="-1">GC</FONT>) in Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.
The resulting binary requires additional runtime support which is present on 
Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X Version 10.5 (Leopard) and later.  All Objective-C objects are presumed 
to be garbage collected. To aid in this effort, compiler implements assignments 
of Objective-C object pointers via runtime support functions. These functions work 
correctly in non-GC environments as well, in case this code is used as part of a 
library.  Assignments of objects into instance variables of other objects are 
intercepted, so are assignments to global object variables. In general, assignments 
through pointers to objects are intercepted. Additionally, assignments of objects 
as fields within structures are intercepted.


<P>


In addition, other pointer variables may be marked with the __strong storage class 
modifier to indicate to the compiler that these assignments need to use the assignment 
runtime functions as well, allowing the memory referenced by these pointers to be 
allocated from the collector. A __weak storage class modifier for pointers is also 
introduced to indicate a zero-ing weak reference. This is permitted only for instance 
variables of an object or globals.  The compiler arranges for all reads as well as 
writes to these variables to occur via runtime support functions.  Under garbage 
collection these variables are not consulted when determining what is not garbage 
and they are set to nil (zero) if the memory they reference is deemed garbage and is 
collected.


<P>




<PRE>
          __strong void *p;  // assignments to 'p' will have runtime support calls
          int *q;            // assignments to 'q' ordinarly will not
            ...
          (__strong int *)q = 0;   // this assignment will call a runtime support function

</PRE>




<P>


Conversely, the <TT>&quot;__weak&quot;</TT> type qualifier may be used to call weak runtime 
functions.


<P>

<DT><B>-fobjc-gc-only</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGU"></A>
Use this option to indicate that the Objective-C program supports garbage 
collection (<FONT SIZE="-1">GC</FONT>) only - that is, it does not contain retain/release logic.
This flag implies <B>-fobjc-gc</B> as well. With this flag, framework
is marked as not honoring retain/release.
<DT><B>-freplace-objc-classes</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGV"></A>
Emit a special marker instructing <B></B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+ld">ld</A><B>(1)</B> not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow <B></B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dyld">dyld</A><B>(1)</B> to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X 10.3
and later.
<DT><B>-fzero-link</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGW"></A>
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to <TT>&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</TT> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the <B>-fzero-link</B> flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <TT>&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</TT>
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
<DT><B>-gen-decls</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGX"></A>
Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named <I>sourcename.decl</I>.
<DT><B>-Wassign-intercept</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGY"></A>
Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.
<DT><B>-Wno-protocol</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGZ"></A>
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the <B>-Wno-protocol</B> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
<DT><B>-Wselector</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHA"></A>
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT>
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the <B>-fsyntax-only</B> option is
being used.
<DT><B>-Wproperty-assign-default</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHB"></A>
Warn if no ``assign'', ``retain'', or ``copy'' attribute is specified on 
a property of pointer to object type. Property is then assumed to be
``assign'' by default.
<DT><B>-Wdirect-ivar-access</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHC"></A>
Warn if ivar of pointer to object type is directly accessed in non-gc
mode, instead of using property syntax access.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-selector-match</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHD"></A>
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type <TT>&quot;id&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;Class&quot;</TT>.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler will omit such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types which share the same size
and alignment.
<DT><B>-Wundeclared-selector</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHE"></A>
Warn if a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
<TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression, either explicitly in an
<TT>@interface</TT> or <TT>@protocol</TT> declaration, or implicitly in
an <TT>@implementation</TT> section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression is found,
while <B>-Wselector</B> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.
<DT><B>-print-objc-runtime-info</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHF"></A>
Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by

<H2>Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting</H2>

<A NAME="ixAHG"></A>
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  The options described
below can be used to control the diagnostic messages formatting
algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Right now, only the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> front end can
honor these options.  However it is expected, in the near future, that
the remaining front ends would be able to digest them correctly.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fmessage-length=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHH"></A>
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about <I>n</I>
characters.  The default is 72 characters for <B>g++</B> and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.  If <I>n</I> is zero, then no
line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a single
line.
<DT><B>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHI"></A>
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit <I>once</I> source location information; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
<DT><B>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHJ"></A>
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
<DT><B>-fdiagnostics-show-option</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHK"></A>
This option instructs the diagnostic machinery to add text to each
diagnostic emitted, which indicates which command line option directly
controls that diagnostic, when such an option is known to the
diagnostic machinery.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</H2>

<A NAME="ixAHL"></A>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
<P>

You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <B>-W</B>,
for example <B>-Wimplicit</B> to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning <B>-Wno-</B> to turn off warnings;
for example, <B>-Wno-implicit</B>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.
<P>

The following options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced
by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>; for further, language-specific options also refer to
<B>C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialect Options</B> and <B>Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialect
Options</B>.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fsyntax-only</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHM"></A>
Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
<DT><B>-pedantic</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHN"></A>
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.  For <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C, follows the
version of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C standard specified by any <B>-std</B> option used.


<P>


Valid <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require <B>-ansi</B> or a
<B>-std</B> option specifying the required version of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C).  However,
without this option, certain <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions and traditional C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.


<P>


<B>-pedantic</B> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <B>__</B>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<TT>&quot;__extension__&quot;</TT>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.


<P>


Some users try to use <B>-pedantic</B> to check programs for strict <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT>
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all---only those for which
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C <I>requires</I> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.


<P>


A feature to report any failure to conform to <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <B>-pedantic</B>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.


<P>


Where the standard specified with <B>-std</B> represents a <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
extended dialect of C, such as <B>gnu89</B> or <B>gnu99</B>, there is a
corresponding <I>base standard</I>, the version of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C on which the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <B>-pedantic</B> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
C dialect, since by definition the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
<DT><B>-pedantic-errors</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHO"></A>
Like <B>-pedantic</B>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
<DT><B>-w</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHP"></A>
Inhibit all warning messages.
<DT><B>-Wno-import</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHQ"></A>
Inhibit warning messages about the use of <B>#import</B>.
<DT><B>-Wno-#warnings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHR"></A>
Inhibit warning messages issued by <B>#warning</B>.
<DT><B>-Wextra-tokens</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHS"></A>
Warn about extra tokens at the end of prepreprocessor directives.  (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-Wnewline-eof</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHT"></A>
Warn about files missing a newline at the end of the file.  (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-Wno-altivec-long-deprecated</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHU"></A>
Do not warn about the use of the deprecated 'long' keyword in
AltiVec data types.  (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-Wchar-subscripts</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHV"></A>
Warn if an array subscript has type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wcomment</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHW"></A>
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <B>/*</B> appears in a <B>/*</B>
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a <B>//</B> comment.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wfatal-errors</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHX"></A>
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
<DT><B>-Wno-format</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHY"></A>
Check calls to <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes, in the <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;strftime&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;strfmon&quot;</TT> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<B>-ffreestanding</B> or <B>-fno-builtin</B>.


<P>


The formats are checked against the format features supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
libc version 2.2.  These include all <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some <FONT SIZE="-1">BSD</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if <B>-pedantic</B> is used
with <B>-Wformat</B>, warnings will be given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <TT>&quot;strfmon&quot;</TT> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).


<P>


Since <B>-Wformat</B> also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, <B>-Wformat</B> also implies <B>-Wnonnull</B>.


<P>


<B>-Wformat</B> is included in <B>-Wall</B>.  For more control over some
aspects of format checking, the options <B>-Wformat-y2k</B>,
<B>-Wno-format-extra-args</B>, <B>-Wno-format-zero-length</B>,
<B>-Wformat-nonliteral</B>, <B>-Wformat-security</B>, and
<B>-Wformat=2</B> are available, but are not included in <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wformat-y2k</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAHZ"></A>
If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, also warn about <TT>&quot;strftime&quot;</TT>
formats which may yield only a two-digit year.
<DT><B>-Wno-format-extra-args</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIA"></A>
If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
<TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.


<P>


Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with <B>$</B> operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <TT>&quot;va_arg&quot;</TT> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT> formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.
<DT><B>-Wno-format-zero-length</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIB"></A>
If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.
<DT><B>-Wformat-nonliteral</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIC"></A>
If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
takes its format arguments as a <TT>&quot;va_list&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-Wno-format-security</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAID"></A>
If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT> functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in <TT>&quot;printf (foo);&quot;</TT>.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains <B></B>%n<B></B>.  (This is
currently a subset of what <B>-Wformat-nonliteral</B> warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to <B>-Wformat-security</B> that are not
included in <B>-Wformat-nonliteral</B>.)
<DT><B>-Wformat=2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIE"></A>
Enable <B>-Wformat</B> plus format checks not included in
<B>-Wformat</B>.  Currently equivalent to <B>-Wformat
-Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k</B>.
<DT><B>-Wnonnull</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIF"></A>
Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the <TT>&quot;nonnull&quot;</TT> function attribute.


<P>


<B>-Wnonnull</B> is included in <B>-Wall</B> and <B>-Wformat</B>.  It
can be disabled with the <B>-Wno-nonnull</B> option.
<DT><B>-Wglobal-constructors</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIG"></A>
Warn about namespace scope data that requires construction or
destruction, or functions that use the constructor attribute or the
destructor attribute.  Additionally warn if the Objective-C <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
runtime is used to initialize various metadata.
<DT><B>-Winit-self</B> (C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAIH"></A>
Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with themselves.
Note this option can only be used with the <B>-Wuninitialized</B> option,
which in turn only works with <B>-O1</B> and above.


<P>


For example, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will warn about <TT>&quot;i&quot;</TT> being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when <B>-Winit-self</B> has been specified:


<P>




<PRE>
        int f()
        {
          int i = i;
          return i;
        }

</PRE>


<DT><B>-Wimplicit-int</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAII"></A>
Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wimplicit-function-declaration</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIJ"></A>

<DT><B>-Werror-implicit-function-declaration</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIK"></A>

Give a warning (or error) whenever a function is used before being
declared.  The form <B>-Wno-error-implicit-function-declaration</B>
is not supported.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B> (as a warning, not an error).
<DT><B>-Wimplicit</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIL"></A>
Same as <B>-Wimplicit-int</B> and <B>-Wimplicit-function-declaration</B>.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wmain</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIM"></A>
Warn if the type of <B>main</B> is suspicious.  <B>main</B> should be a
function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wmissing-braces</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIN"></A>
Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for <B>a</B> is not fully
bracketed, but that for <B>b</B> is fully bracketed.


<P>




<PRE>
        int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
        int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wmissing-include-dirs</B> (C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAIO"></A>
Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.
<DT><B>-Wparentheses</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIP"></A>
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.  Only the warning for an assignment used as
a truth value is supported when compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>; the other warnings are
only supported when compiling C.


<P>


Also warn if a comparison like <B>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</B> appears; this is
equivalent to <B>(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</B>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.


<P>


Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement an <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
          if (a)
            if (b)
              foo ();
          else
            bar ();
        }

</PRE>




<P>


In C, every <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> branch belongs to the innermost possible <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>
statement, which in this example is <TT>&quot;if (b)&quot;</TT>.  This is often not
what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will issue a warning when this flag is specified.
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
<TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement so there is no way the <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> could belong to
the enclosing <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>.  The resulting code would look like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
          if (a)
            {
              if (b)
                foo ();
              else
                bar ();
            }
        }

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wsequence-point</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIQ"></A>
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standards.


<P>


The C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standards defines the order in which expressions in a C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
program are evaluated in terms of <I>sequence points</I>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<TT>&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;||&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;? :&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;,&quot;</TT> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.


<P>


It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standards specify that ``Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.''.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.


<P>


Examples of code with undefined behavior are <TT>&quot;a = a++;&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;a[n]
= b[n++]&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;a[i++] = i;&quot;</TT>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.


<P>


The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> readings page, at
&lt;<B><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</A></B>&gt;.

Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to
<TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.  Also warn about any <TT>&quot;return&quot;</TT> statement with no
return-value in a function whose return-type is not <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>.


<P>


For C, also warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT>.  Such a type qualifier has no effect, since the
value returned by a function is not an lvalue.  <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C prohibits
qualified <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT> return types on function definitions, so such
return types always receive a warning even without this option.


<P>


For C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when <B>-Wno-return-type</B> is specified.  The only
exceptions are <B>main</B> and functions defined in system headers.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wswitch</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIS"></A>
Warn whenever a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a <TT>&quot;case&quot;</TT> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a <TT>&quot;default&quot;</TT> label prevents this
warning.)  <TT>&quot;case&quot;</TT> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wswitch-default</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIT"></A>
Warn whenever a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement does not have a <TT>&quot;default&quot;</TT>
case.
<DT><B>-Wswitch-enum</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIU"></A>
Warn whenever a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a <TT>&quot;case&quot;</TT> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  <TT>&quot;case&quot;</TT> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
<DT><B>-Wtrigraphs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIV"></A>
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of
the program (trigraphs within comments are not warned about).
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wunused-function</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIW"></A>
Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a
non-inline static function is unused.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wunused-label</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIX"></A>
Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.


<P>


To suppress this warning use the <B>unused</B> attribute.
<DT><B>-Wunused-parameter</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIY"></A>
Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.


<P>


To suppress this warning use the <B>unused</B> attribute.
<DT><B>-Wunused-variable</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAIZ"></A>
Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is unused
aside from its declaration.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.


<P>


To suppress this warning use the <B>unused</B> attribute.
<DT><B>-Wunused-value</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJA"></A>
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.


<P>


To suppress this warning cast the expression to <B>void</B>.
<DT><B>-Wunused</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJB"></A>
All the above <B>-Wunused</B> options combined.


<P>


In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify <B>-Wextra -Wunused</B> (note that <B>-Wall</B> implies
<B>-Wunused</B>), or separately specify <B>-Wunused-parameter</B>.
<DT><B>-Wuninitialized</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJC"></A>
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized or
if a variable may be clobbered by a <TT>&quot;setjmp&quot;</TT> call.


<P>


These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you do not specify <B>-O</B>, you will not get 
these warnings. Instead, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will issue a warning about <B>-Wuninitialized</B>
requiring <B>-O</B>.


<P>


If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the <B>-Winit-self</B> option.


<P>


These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables which are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared <TT>&quot;volatile&quot;</TT>.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings will depend on the precise optimization
options and version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> used.


<P>


Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.


<P>


These warnings are made optional because <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
          int x;
          switch (y)
            {
            case 1: x = 1;
              break;
            case 2: x = 4;
              break;
            case 3: x = 5;
            }
          foo (x);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


If the value of <TT>&quot;y&quot;</TT> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <TT>&quot;x&quot;</TT> is
always initialized, but <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
          int save_y;
          if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
          ...
          if (change_y) y = save_y;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


This has no bug because <TT>&quot;save_y&quot;</TT> is used only if it is set.


<P>


This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <TT>&quot;longjmp&quot;</TT>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.


<P>


The compiler sees only the calls to <TT>&quot;setjmp&quot;</TT>.  It cannot know
where <TT>&quot;longjmp&quot;</TT> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <TT>&quot;longjmp&quot;</TT> cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.


<P>


Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT>.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wunknown-pragmas</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJD"></A>
Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not understood by
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.  If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings were only enabled by the <B>-Wall</B> command line option.
<DT><B>-Wno-pragmas</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJE"></A>
Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters,
invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
<B>-Wunknown-pragmas</B>.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-aliasing</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJF"></A>
This option is only active when <B>-fstrict-aliasing</B> is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-aliasing=2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJG"></A>
This option is only active when <B>-fstrict-aliasing</B> is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  This warning catches more cases than
<B>-Wstrict-aliasing</B>, but it will also give a warning for some ambiguous
cases that are safe.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-overflow</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJH"></A>

<DT><B>-Wstrict-overflow=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJI"></A>

This option is only active when <B>-fstrict-overflow</B> is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.


<P>


An optimization which assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code which is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
will require, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-Wstrict-overflow=1</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJJ"></A>
Warn about cases which are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example: <TT>&quot;x + 1 &gt; x&quot;</TT>; with <B>-fstrict-overflow</B>, the
compiler will simplify this to <TT>1</TT>.  This level of
<B>-Wstrict-overflow</B> is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-overflow=2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJK"></A>
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: <TT>&quot;abs (x) &gt;= 0&quot;</TT>.  This can only be
simplified when <B>-fstrict-overflow</B> is in effect, because
<TT>&quot;abs (INT_MIN)&quot;</TT> overflows to <TT>&quot;INT_MIN&quot;</TT>, which is less than
zero.  <B>-Wstrict-overflow</B> (with no level) is the same as
<B>-Wstrict-overflow=2</B>.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-overflow=3</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJL"></A>
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: <TT>&quot;x + 1 &gt; 1&quot;</TT> will be simplified to <TT>&quot;x &gt; 0&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-overflow=4</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJM"></A>
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: <TT>&quot;(x * 10) / 5&quot;</TT> will be simplified to <TT>&quot;x * 2&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-overflow=5</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJN"></A>
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: <TT>&quot;x + 2 &gt; y&quot;</TT> will
be simplified to <TT>&quot;x + 1 &gt;= y&quot;</TT>.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level will give a very large number of
false positives.

All of the above <B>-W</B> options combined.  This enables all the

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
off the end of the function body is considered returning without
a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:


<P>




<PRE>
        foo (a)
        {
          if (a &gt; 0)
            return a;
        }

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
contains no side effects.
To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void.
For example, an expression such as <B>x[i,j]</B> will cause a warning,
but <B>x[(void)i,j]</B> will not.
<DT>*<DD>
An unsigned value is compared against zero with <B>&lt;</B> or <B>&gt;=</B>.
<DT>*<DD>
Storage-class specifiers like <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> are not the first things in
a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.
<DT>*<DD>
If <B>-Wall</B> or <B>-Wunused</B> is also specified, warn about unused
arguments.
<DT>*<DD>
A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an
incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
(But don't warn if <B>-Wno-sign-compare</B> is also specified.)
<DT>*<DD>
An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all members.
This warning can be independently controlled by
<B>-Wmissing-field-initializers</B>.
<DT>*<DD>
An initialized field without side effects is overridden when using

A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&amp;R-style

<DT><B>-Wno-div-by-zero</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJR"></A>
Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating point
division by zero is not warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of
obtaining infinities and NaNs.
<DT><B>-Wsystem-headers</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJS"></A>
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using <B>-Wall</B> in conjunction with this
option will <I>not</I> warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers---for that, <B>-Wunknown-pragmas</B> must also be used.
<DT><B>-Wfloat-equal</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJT"></A>
Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.


<P>


The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.
<DT><B>-Wfour-char-constants</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJU"></A>
Warn about four char constants, e.g. OSType '<FONT SIZE="-1">APPL</FONT>'.  This warning is 
disabled by default.
<DT><B>-Wtraditional</B> (C only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAJV"></A>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C.  Also warn about <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which should be avoided.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C.
<DT>*<DD>
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the <B>#</B> appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<B>-Wtraditional</B> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the <B>#</B> does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<B>#pragma</B> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize <B>#elif</B>, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.
<DT>*<DD>
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
<DT>*<DD>
The unary plus operator.
<DT>*<DD>
The <B>U</B> integer constant suffix, or the <B>F</B> or <B>L</B> floating point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the <B>L</B> suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the <B>_MIN</B>/<B>_MAX</B> macros in <TT>&quot;&lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/limits.h">limits.h</A>&gt;&quot;</TT>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.
<DT>*<DD>
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
<DT>*<DD>
A <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement has an operand of type <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
A non-<TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> function declaration follows a <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
<DT>*<DD>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
<DT>*<DD>
Usage of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> string concatenation is detected.
<DT>*<DD>
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
<DT>*<DD>
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
<DT>*<DD>
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <TT>&quot;__STDC__&quot;</TT> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
<DT>*<DD>
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use <B>-Wconversion</B>.
<DT>*<DD>
Use of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<I>not</I> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <TT>&quot;PARAMS&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;VPARAMS&quot;</TT>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

Warn whenever an object of larger than <I>len</I> bytes is defined.
<DT><B>-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKC"></A>
Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler could not

such assumptions.
<DT><B>-Wpointer-arith</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKD"></A>
Warn about anything that depends on the ``size of'' a function type or
of <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with <TT>&quot;void *&quot;</TT> pointers and pointers

<DT><B>-Wbad-function-cast</B> (C only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKE"></A>
Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
For example, warn if <TT>&quot;int malloc()&quot;</TT> is cast to <TT>&quot;anything *&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-Wc++-compat</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKF"></A>
Warn about <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C constructs that are outside of the common subset of

<DT><B>-Wcast-qual</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKG"></A>
Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from

to an ordinary <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-Wcast-align</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKH"></A>
Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the

an <TT>&quot;int *&quot;</TT> on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two- or four-byte boundaries.
<DT><B>-Wwrite-strings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKI"></A>
When compiling C, give string constants the type <TT>&quot;const
char[</TT>length<TT>]&quot;</TT> so that
copying the address of one into a non-<TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT> <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT>

deprecated conversion from string literals to <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT>.  This
warning, by default, is enabled for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.
These warnings will help you find at
compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
only if you have been very careful about using <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT> in
declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make <B>-Wall</B> request these warnings.
<DT><B>-Wconversion</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKJ"></A>
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.


<P>


Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the assignment
<TT>&quot;x = -1&quot;</TT> if <TT>&quot;x&quot;</TT> is unsigned.  But do not warn about explicit
casts like <TT>&quot;(unsigned) -1&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-Wshorten-64-to-32</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKK"></A>
Warn if a value is implicitly converted from a 64 bit type to a 32 bit type.
<DT><B>-Wempty-body</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKL"></A>
Warn if an empty body occurs in an <B>if</B> or <B>else</B>
statement.  Additionally, in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, warn when an empty body occurs
in a <B>while</B> or <B>for</B> statement with no whitespacing before
the semicolon.  This warning is also enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT><B>-Wsign-compare</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKM"></A>
Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
This warning is also enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>; to get the other warnings
of <B>-Wextra</B> without this warning, use <B>-Wextra -Wno-sign-compare</B>.
<DT><B>-Waddress</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKN"></A>
Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
<TT>&quot;void func(void); if (func)&quot;</TT>, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as <TT>&quot;if (x == &quot;abc&quot;)&quot;</TT>.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use <TT>&quot;strcmp&quot;</TT>.  This warning is enabled by
<B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Waggregate-return</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKO"></A>
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)
<DT><B>-Wno-attributes</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKP"></A>
Do not warn if an unexpected <TT>&quot;__attribute__&quot;</TT> is used, such as
unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
etc.  This will not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
attributes.
<DT><B>-Wstrict-prototypes</B> (C only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKQ"></A>
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument
types.)
<DT><B>-Wold-style-definition</B> (C only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKR"></A>
Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.
<DT><B>-Wmissing-prototypes</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKS"></A>
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that fail
to be declared in header files.
<DT><B>-Wmissing-declarations</B> (C only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKT"></A>
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.
<DT><B>-Wmissing-field-initializers</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKU"></A>
Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
<TT>&quot;x.h&quot;</TT> is implicitly zero:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct s { int f, g, h; };
        struct s x = { 3, 4 };

</PRE>




<P>


This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification would not trigger a warning:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct s { int f, g, h; };
        struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is included in <B>-Wextra</B>.  To get other <B>-Wextra</B>
warnings without this one, use <B>-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers</B>.
<DT><B>-Wmissing-noreturn</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKV"></A>
Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute <TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT>.
Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.  Care should
be taken to manually verify functions actually do not ever return before
adding the <TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT> attribute, otherwise subtle code generation
bugs could be introduced.  You will not get a warning for <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> in
hosted C environments.
<DT><B>-Wmissing-format-attribute</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKW"></A>
Warn about function pointers which might be candidates for <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT>
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will guess that function pointers with <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT>
attribute to avoid the warning.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will also warn about function definitions which might be
candidates for <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will guess that <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
<TT>&quot;vprintf&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;vscanf&quot;</TT>, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.
<DT><B>-Wno-multichar</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKX"></A>
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (<B>'</B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>FOO</B></FONT><B>'</B>) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
This flag does not control warning for a constant with four characters,
use -Wfour-char-constants instead.
<DT><B>-Wnormalized=&lt;none|id|nfc|nfkc&gt;</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKY"></A>
In <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> 10646 standard sets out some <I>normalization rules</I> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can warn you if you are using identifiers which
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.


<P>


There are four levels of warning that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports.  The default is
<B>-Wnormalized=nfc</B>, which warns about any identifier which is
not in the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> 10646 ``C'' normalized form, <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>NFC</I></FONT><I></I>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">NFC</FONT> is the
recommended form for most uses.


<P>


Unfortunately, there are some characters which <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> allow
in identifiers that when turned into <FONT SIZE="-1">NFC</FONT> aren't allowable as
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and have all your identifiers in <FONT SIZE="-1">NFC</FONT>.
<B>-Wnormalized=id</B> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.


<P>


You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<B>-Wnormalized=none</B>.  You would only want to do this if you
were using some other normalization scheme (like ``D''), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.


<P>


Some characters in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <TT>&quot;\u207F&quot;</TT>, ``<FONT SIZE="-1">SUPERSCRIPT</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">LATIN</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">SMALL</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">LETTER</FONT> N'', will display just like a regular <TT>&quot;n&quot;</TT> which has been
placed in a superscript.  <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> 10646 defines the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>NFKC</I></FONT><I></I>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will warn if your code is not in <FONT SIZE="-1">NFKC</FONT> if you use
<B>-Wnormalized=nfkc</B>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment is
unable to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.
<DT><B>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKZ"></A>
Do not warn about uses of functions,
variables, and types marked as deprecated by using the <TT>&quot;deprecated&quot;</TT>
attribute.
<DT><B>-Wno-overflow</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALA"></A>
Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.
<DT><B>-Woverride-init</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALB"></A>
Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers.


<P>


This warning is included in <B>-Wextra</B>.  To get other
<B>-Wextra</B> warnings without this one, use <B>-Wextra
-Wno-override-init</B>.
<DT><B>-Wpacked</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALC"></A>
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable <TT>&quot;f.x&quot;</TT> in <TT>&quot;struct bar&quot;</TT>
will be misaligned even though <TT>&quot;struct bar&quot;</TT> does not itself
have the packed attribute:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct foo {
          int x;
          char a, b, c, d;
        } __attribute__((packed));
        struct bar {
          char z;
          struct foo f;
        };

</PRE>


<DT><B>-Wpadded</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALD"></A>
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
<DT><B>-Wredundant-decls</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALE"></A>
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
<DT><B>-Wnested-externs</B> (C only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixALF"></A>
Warn if an <TT>&quot;extern&quot;</TT> declaration is encountered within a function.
<DT><B>-Wunreachable-code</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALG"></A>
Warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed.


<P>


This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at
least a whole line of source code will never be executed, because
some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
procedure that never returns.


<P>


It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there
are circumstances under which part of the affected line can be executed,
so care should be taken when removing apparently-unreachable code.


<P>


For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the
line is unreachable in only one inlined copy of the function.


<P>


This option is not made part of <B>-Wall</B> because in a debugging
version of a program there is often substantial code which checks
correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable
because the program does work.  Another common use of unreachable
code is to provide behavior which is selectable at compile-time.
<DT><B>-Winline</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALH"></A>
Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline.
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.


<P>


The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <B>-Winline</B> to appear or disappear.
<DT><B>-Wno-invalid-offsetof</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixALI"></A>
Suppress warnings from applying the <B>offsetof</B> macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard, applying <B>offsetof</B>
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> implementations,
however, <B>offsetof</B> typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
<B>struct</B> that fails to be a <FONT SIZE="-1">POD</FONT> type only by virtue of having a
constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.


<P>


The restrictions on <B>offsetof</B> may be relaxed in a future version
of the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard.
<DT><B>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast</B> (C only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixALJ"></A>
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
different size.
<DT><B>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast</B> (C only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixALK"></A>
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
different size.
<DT><B>-Winvalid-pch</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALL"></A>
Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but can't be used.
<DT><B>-Wlong-long</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALM"></A>
Warn if <B>long long</B> type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit
the warning messages, use <B>-Wno-long-long</B>.  Flags
<B>-Wlong-long</B> and <B>-Wno-long-long</B> are taken into account
only when <B>-pedantic</B> flag is used.
<DT><B>-Wvariadic-macros</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALN"></A>
Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90 mode, or the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
alternate syntax when in pedantic <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99 mode.  This is default.
To inhibit the warning messages, use <B>-Wno-variadic-macros</B>.
<DT><B>-Wvolatile-register-var</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALO"></A>
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.
<DT><B>-Wdisabled-optimization</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALP"></A>
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s optimizers were unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
<DT><B>-Wpointer-sign</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALQ"></A>
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
<B>-Wall</B> and by <B>-pedantic</B>, which can be disabled with
<B>-Wno-pointer-sign</B>.
<DT><B>-Werror</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALR"></A>
Make all warnings into errors.
<DT><B>-Werror=</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALS"></A>
Make the specified warning into an errors.  The specifier for a
warning is appended, for example <B>-Werror=switch</B> turns the
warnings controlled by <B>-Wswitch</B> into errors.  This switch
takes a negative form, to be used to negate <B>-Werror</B> for
specific warnings, for example <B>-Wno-error=switch</B> makes
<B>-Wswitch</B> warnings not be errors, even when <B>-Werror</B>
is in effect.  You can use the <B>-fdiagnostics-show-option</B>
option to have each controllable warning amended with the option which
controls it, to determine what to use with this option.


<P>


Note that specifying <B>-Werror=</B><I>foo</I> automatically implies
<B>-W</B><I>foo</I>.  However, <B>-Wno-error=</B><I>foo</I> does not
imply anything.
<DT><B>-Wstack-protector</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALT"></A>
This option is only active when <B>-fstack-protector</B> is active.  It
warns about functions that will not be protected against stack smashing.
<DT><B>-Woverlength-strings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALU"></A>
Warn about string constants which are longer than the ``minimum
maximum'' length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants which are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.


<P>


The limit applies <I>after</I> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing <FONT SIZE="-1">NUL</FONT>.  In C89, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


This option is implied by <B>-pedantic</B>, and can be disabled with
<B>-Wno-overlength-strings</B>.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options for Debugging Your Program or <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT></H2>

<A NAME="ixALV"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC:</FONT>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-g</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALW"></A>
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, <FONT SIZE="-1">COFF</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">XCOFF</FONT>, or <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> 2).  <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> can work with this debugging
information.


<P>


On most systems that use stabs format, <B>-g</B> enables use of extra
debugging information that only <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <B>-gstabs+</B> or <B>-gstabs</B>
(see below).


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> allows you to use <B>-g</B> with
<B>-O</B>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.


<P>


Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.


<P>


The following options are useful when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
<DT><B>-ggdb</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALX"></A>
Produce debugging information for use by <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT>.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (<FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> extensions if at all
possible.
<DT><B>-gstabs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALY"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> extensions.  This is the format used by <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> on most <FONT SIZE="-1">BSD</FONT>
systems.  On <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS</FONT>, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">SDB</FONT>.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> assembler.
<DT><B>-flimit-debug-info</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALZ"></A>
Limit debug information produced to reduce size of debug binary.
<DT><B>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMA"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
<DT><B>-femit-class-debug-always</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMB"></A>
Instead of emitting debugging information for a C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option will increase the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
<DT><B>-gstabs+</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMC"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions understood only by the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> debugger (<FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT>).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
<DT><B>-gdwarf-2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMD"></A>
Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> version 2 format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> on <FONT SIZE="-1">IRIX</FONT> 6.  With this
option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses features of <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> version 3 when they are useful;
version 3 is upward compatible with version 2, but may still cause
problems for older debuggers.


<P>


(Other debug formats, such as <B>-gcoff</B>, are not supported in
Darwin or Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X.)
<DT><B>-g</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAME"></A>

<DT><B>-ggdb</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMF"></A>
<DT><B>-gstabs</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMG"></A>

Request debugging information and also use <I>level</I> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.


<P>


Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <B>-g0</B> negates
<B>-g</B>.


<P>


Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.


<P>


Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <B>-g3</B>.


<P>


<B>-gdwarf-2</B> does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> used to support an option <B>-gdwarf</B> that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional <B>-g</B><I>level</I> option to change the
debug level for <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT>.
<DT><B>-feliminate-dwarf2-dups</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMH"></A>
Compress <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT> debugging information by eliminating duplicated
information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
generating <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT> debugging information with <B>-gdwarf-2</B>.
<DT><B>-p</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMI"></A>
Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <B>prof</B>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
<DT><B>-pg</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMJ"></A>
Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <B>gprof</B>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
<DT><B>-Q</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMK"></A>
Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
<DT><B>-ftime-report</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAML"></A>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each
pass when it finishes.
<DT><B>-fmem-report</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMM"></A>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.
<DT><B>-fopt-diary</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMN"></A>
Enable optimization diary entries using <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> encoding. This option
does nothing unless <B>gdwarf-2</B> is specified.
<DT><B>-fprofile-arcs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMO"></A>
Add code so that program flow <I>arcs</I> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<I>auxname.gcda</I> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>), or for
test coverage analysis (<B>-ftest-coverage</B>).  Each object file's
<I>auxname</I> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. <I>foo.gcda</I> for input file <I>dir/foo.c</I>, or
<I>dir/foo.gcda</I> for output file specified as <B>-o dir/foo.o</B>).
<DT><B>--coverage</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMP"></A>
This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>
<B>-ftest-coverage</B> (when compiling) and <B>-lgcov</B> (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Compile the source files with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <B>-ftest-coverage</B> option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.
<DT>*<DD>
Link your object files with <B>-lgcov</B> or <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>
(the latter implies the former).
<DT>*<DD>
Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Also
<TT>&quot;fork&quot;</TT> calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).

<P>


With <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, for each function of your program <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

Produce a notes file that the <B>gcov</B> code-coverage utility can use to
show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called
<I>auxname.gcno</I>.  Refer to the <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> option
above for a description of <I>auxname</I> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data.  Coverage data will match the source files
more closely, if you do not optimize.

<DT><B>-fdump-rtl-</B><I>pass</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMS"></A>

Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<I>letters</I>.    This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending a
pass number and a word to the <I>dumpname</I>.  <I>dumpname</I> is generated
from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not
an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file. These
switches may have different effects when <B>-E</B> is used for
preprocessing.

<DT><B>-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixARN"></A>
This option controls the amount of debugging output the vectorizer prints.
This information is written to standard error, unless 
<B>-fdump-tree-all</B> or <B>-fdump-tree-vect</B> is specified, 
in which case it is output to the usual dump listing file, <I>.vect</I>.
For <I>n</I>=0 no diagnostic information is reported.
If <I>n</I>=1 the vectorizer reports each loop that got vectorized, 
and the total number of loops that got vectorized.
If <I>n</I>=2 the vectorizer also reports non-vectorized loops that passed 
the first analysis phase (vect_analyze_loop_form) - i.e. countable, 
inner-most, single-bb, single-entry/exit loops.  This is the same verbosity 
level that <B>-fdump-tree-vect-stats</B> uses.
Higher verbosity levels mean either more information dumped for each 
reported loop, or same amount of information reported for more loops:
If <I>n</I>=3, alignment related information is added to the reports.
If <I>n</I>=4, data-references related information (e.g. memory dependences, 
memory access-patterns) is added to the reports.
If <I>n</I>=5, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized inner-most loops 
that did not pass the first analysis phase (i.e. may not be countable, or 
may have complicated control-flow).
If <I>n</I>=6, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized nested loops.
For <I>n</I>=7, all the information the vectorizer generates during its 
analysis and transformation is reported.  This is the same verbosity level
that <B>-fdump-tree-vect-details</B> uses.
<DT><B>-frandom-seed=</B><I>string</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixARO"></A>
This option provides a seed that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses when it would otherwise use
random numbers.  It is used to generate certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the <B>-frandom-seed</B> option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.


<P>


The <I>string</I> should be different for every file you compile.
<DT><B>-fsched-verbose=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixARP"></A>
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless <B>-dS</B> or <B>-dR</B> is
specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump
listing file, <I>.sched</I> or <I>.sched2</I> respectively.  However
for <I>n</I> greater than nine, the output is always printed to standard
error.


<P>


For <I>n</I> greater than zero, <B>-fsched-verbose</B> outputs the
same information as <B>-dRS</B>.  For <I>n</I> greater than one, it
also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready list information
and unit/insn info.  For <I>n</I> greater than two, it includes <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT>
at abort point, control-flow and regions info.  And for <I>n</I> over
four, <B>-fsched-verbose</B> also includes dependence info.
<DT><B>-save-temps</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARQ"></A>
Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <I>foo.c</I> with <B>-c -save-temps</B> would produce files
<I>foo.i</I> and <I>foo.s</I>, as well as <I>foo.o</I>.  This creates a
preprocessed <I>foo.i</I> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.


<P>


When used in combination with the <B>-x</B> command line option,
<B>-save-temps</B> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using <B>-save-temps</B>.
<DT><B>-time</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARR"></A>
Report the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).  The output looks like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        # cc1 0.12 0.01
        # as 0.00 0.01

</PRE>




<P>


The first number on each line is the ``user time'', that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is ``system time'',
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
<DT><B>-fvar-tracking</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARS"></A>
Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each
position in code.  Better debugging information is then generated
(if the debugging information format supports this information).


<P>


It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<B>-Os</B>,
<B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-Oz</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>), ...), debugging information (<B>-g</B>) and
the debug info format supports it.
<DT><B>-print-file-name=</B><I>library</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixART"></A>
Print the full absolute name of the library file <I>library</I> that
would be used when linking---and don't do anything else.  With this
option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.
<DT><B>-print-multi-directory</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARU"></A>
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.
<DT><B>-print-multi-lib</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARV"></A>
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
<B>;</B>, and each switch starts with an <B>@} instead of the
</B>@samp<B>{-</B>, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell-processing.
<DT><B>-print-prog-name=</B><I>program</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixARW"></A>
Like <B>-print-file-name</B>, but searches for a program such as <B>cpp</B>.
<DT><B>-print-libgcc-file-name</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARX"></A>
Same as <B>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</B>.


<P>


This is useful when you use <B>-nostdlib</B> or <B>-nodefaultlibs</B>
but you do want to link with <I>libgcc.a</I>.  You can do


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

</PRE>


<DT><B>-print-search-dirs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARY"></A>
Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories <B>gcc</B> will search---and don't do anything else.


<P>


This is useful when <B>gcc</B> prints the error message
<B>installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</B>.
To resolve this you either need to put <I>cpp0</I> and the other compiler
components where <B>gcc</B> expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> to the directory where you installed them.
Don't forget the trailing <B>/</B>.
<DT><B>-dumpmachine</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARZ"></A>
Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
<B>i686-pc-linux-gnu</B>)---and don't do anything else.
<DT><B>-dumpversion</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASA"></A>
Print the compiler version (for example, <B>3.0</B>)---and don't do
anything else.
<DT><B>-dumpspecs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASB"></A>
Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> itself is being built.)
<DT><B>-feliminate-unused-debug-types</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASC"></A>
Normally, when producing <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT> output, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
With this option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will avoid producing debug symbol output
for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options That Control Optimization</H2>

<A NAME="ixASD"></A>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
<P>

Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
<P>

Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
<P>

The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of
the program.  Optimization levels <B>-O</B> and above, in
particular, enable <I>unit-at-a-time</I> mode, which allows the
compiler to consider information gained from later functions in
the file when compiling a function.  Compiling multiple files at
once to a single output file in <I>unit-at-a-time</I> mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.
<P>

Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-O</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASE"></A>

<DT><B>-O1</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASF"></A>

Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.


<P>


With <B>-O</B>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.


<P>


<B>-O</B> turns on the following optimization flags:
<B>-fdefer-pop 
-fdelayed-branch 
-fguess-branch-probability 
-fcprop-registers 
-fif-conversion 
-fif-conversion2 
-ftree-ccp 
-ftree-dce 
-ftree-dominator-opts

-ftree-ter 
-ftree-lrs 
-ftree-sra 
-ftree-copyrename 
-ftree-fre 
-ftree-ch 
-funit-at-a-time 
-fmerge-constants</B>


<P>


<B>-O</B> also turns on <B>-fomit-frame-pointer</B> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.
<DT><B>-O2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASG"></A>
Optimize even more.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify <B>-O2</B>.
As compared to <B>-O</B>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.


<P>


<B>-O2</B> turns on all optimization flags specified by <B>-O</B>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
<B>-fthread-jumps 
-fcrossjumping 
-foptimize-sibling-calls 
-fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks 
-fgcse  -fgcse-lm  
-fexpensive-optimizations 
-frerun-cse-after-loop  
-fcaller-saves 
-fpeephole2 
-fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2 
-fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec 
-fregmove 
-fstrict-aliasing -fstrict-overflow 
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks 
-freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions 
-falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
-falign-loops  -falign-labels 
-ftree-vrp 
-ftree-pre</B>


<P>


Please note the warning under <B>-fgcse</B> about
invoking <B>-O2</B> on programs that use computed gotos.


<P>


<B>-O2</B> doesn't turn on <B>-ftree-vrp</B> for the Ada compiler.
This option must be explicitly specified on the command line to be
enabled for the Ada compiler.


<P>


In Apple's version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>, <B>-fstrict-aliasing</B>,
<B>-freorder-blocks</B>, and <B>-fsched-interblock</B>
are disabled by default when optimizing.
<DT><B>-O3</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASH"></A>
Optimize yet more.  <B>-O3</B> turns on all optimizations specified by
<B>-O2</B> and also turns on the <B>-finline-functions</B>,
<B>-funswitch-loops</B> and <B>-fgcse-after-reload</B> options.
<DT><B>-O0</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASI"></A>
Do not optimize.  This is the default.
<DT><B>-fast</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASJ"></A>
Optimize for maximum performance. <B>-fast</B> changes the overall optimization 
strategy of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> in order to produce the fastest possible running code for <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC7450</FONT> 
and G5 architectures. By default, <B>-fast</B> optimizes for G5. Programs 
optimized for G5 will not run on <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC7450</FONT>. To optimize for <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC7450</FONT>, add 
<B>-mcpu=7450</B> on command line.


<P>


<B>-fast</B> currently enables the following optimization flags (for G5 and <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC7450</FONT>). 
These flags may change in the future.  You cannot override any of these options if you use 
<B>-fast</B> except by setting <B>-mcpu=7450</B> (or <B>-fPIC</B>, see below).


<P>


<B>-O3
-falign-loops-max-skip=15
-falign-jumps-max-skip=15
-falign-loops=16
-falign-jumps=16
-falign-functions=16

-ffast-math
-fstrict-aliasing
-funroll-loops
-ftree-loop-linear
-ftree-loop-memset
-mcpu=G5
-mpowerpc-gpopt
-mtune=G5  (unless -mtune=G4 is specified).
-fsched-interblock
-fgcse-sm
-mpowerpc64</B>


<P>


To build shared libraries with <B>-fast</B>, specify <B>-fPIC</B>
on the command line as <B>-fast</B> turns on <B>-mdynamic-no-pic</B>
otherwise.


<P>


Important notes: <B>-ffast-math</B> results in code that is not necessarily 
IEEE-compliant.  <B>-fstrict-aliasing</B> is highly likely to break 
non-standard-compliant programs.  <B>-malign-natural</B> only works properly if
the entire program is compiled with it, and none of the standard headers/libraries
contain any code that changes alignment when this option is used.


<P>


On Intel target, <B>-fast</B> currently enables the following optimization flags:


<P>


<B>-O3
-fomit-frame-pointer
-fstrict-aliasing
-momit-leaf-frame-pointer
-fno-tree-pre
-falign-loops</B>


<P>


All choices of flags enabled by <B>-fast</B> are subject to change without notice.
<DT><B>-Os</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASK"></A>
Optimize for size, but not at the expense of speed.
<B>-Os</B> enables all <B>-O2</B> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  However, instructions
are chosen for best performance, regardless of size.
To optimize solely for size on Darwin, use <B>-Oz</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>).


<P>


The following options are set for <B>-O2</B>, but are disabled under <B>-Os</B>:
<B>-falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops 
-falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition 
-fprefetch-loop-arrays  -ftree-vect-loop-version</B>


<P>


When optimizing with <B>-Os</B> or <B>-Oz</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>) on
Darwin, any function up to 30 ``estimated insns'' in size will be
considered for inlining.  When compiling C and Objective-C sourcefiles with
<B>-Os</B> or <B>-Oz</B> on Darwin, functions explictly marked
with the <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> keyword up to 450 ``estimated insns'' in size
will be considered for inlining.
When compiling for Apple <FONT SIZE="-1">POWERPC</FONT> targets, <B>-Os</B> and
<B>-Oz</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>) disable use of the string instructions even though they
would usually be smaller, because the kernel can't emulate them
correctly in some rare cases.  This behavior is not portable to any
other gcc environment, and will not affect most programs at all.  If
you really want the string instructions, use -mstring.
<DT><B>-Oz</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASL"></A>
(<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>) Optimize for size, regardless of performance.
<B>-Oz</B> enables the same optimization flags that <B>-Os</B>
uses, but <B>-Oz</B> also enables other optimizations intended solely
to reduce code size.  In particular, instructions that encode into
fewer bytes are preferred over longer instructions that execute in
fewer cycles.  <B>-Oz</B> on Darwin is very similar to <B>-Os</B>
in <FONT SIZE="-1">FSF</FONT> distributions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.  <B>-Oz</B> employs the same inlining
limits and avoids string instructions just like <B>-Os</B>.


<P>


If you use multiple <B>-O</B> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
</DL>
<P>

Options of the form <B>-f</B><I>flag</I> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <B>-ffoo</B> would be <B>-fno-foo</B>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing <B>no-</B>
or adding it.
<P>

The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <B>-O</B> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when ``fine-tuning'' of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fno-default-inline</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASM"></A>
Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<B>-O</B>, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add <B>inline</B> in front of
the member function name.
<DT><B>-fno-defer-pop</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASN"></A>
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.


<P>


Disabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>,
<B>-Oz</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>).
<DT><B>-fforce-mem</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASO"></A>
Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not common
subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate
register-load. This option is now a nop and will be removed in 4.3.
<DT><B>-fforce-addr</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASP"></A>
Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.
<DT><B>-fomit-frame-pointer</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASQ"></A>
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <B>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</B>


<P>


On some machines, such as the <FONT SIZE="-1">VAX</FONT>, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <TT>&quot;FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED&quot;</TT> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>, <B>-Oz</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>).
<DT><B>-foptimize-sibling-calls</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASR"></A>
Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>, <B>-Oz</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>).
<DT><B>-fno-inline</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASS"></A>
Don't pay attention to the <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.
<DT><B>-finline-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAST"></A>
Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.


<P>


If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.


<P>


Enabled at level <B>-O3</B>.
<DT><B>-finline-functions-called-once</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASU"></A>
Consider all <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.


<P>


Enabled if <B>-funit-at-a-time</B> is enabled.
<DT><B>-fearly-inlining</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASV"></A>
Inline functions marked by <TT>&quot;always_inline&quot;</TT> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<B>-fprofile-generate</B> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.


<P>


Enabled by default.
<DT><B>-finline-limit=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixASW"></A>
By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (i.e., marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class
definition in c++).  <I>n</I> is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of <I>n</I> is 600.
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <B>--param</B> <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>value</I>.
The <B>-finline-limit=</B><I>n</I> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>

<P>


<I>Note:</I> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an

release to an another.
</DL>

<DT><B>-fkeep-inline-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATB"></A>
In C, emit <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> functions that are declared <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<TT>&quot;extern inline&quot;</TT> extension in <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> C.  In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.
<DT><B>-fkeep-static-consts</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATC"></A>
Emit variables declared <TT>&quot;static const&quot;</TT> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <B>-fno-keep-static-consts</B> option.
<DT><B>-flocal-alloc</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATD"></A>
(<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>) Enable the local (intra-basic-block) register allocator.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
supress register allocation within a basic block, use the
<B>-fno-local-alloc</B> option.  This option cannot be disabled with
<B>-O0</B>, for correctness reasons.
<DT><B>-fmerge-constants</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATE"></A>
Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating point
constants) across compilation units.


<P>


This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <B>-fno-merge-constants</B> to inhibit this
behavior.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>, <B>-Oz</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>).
<DT><B>-fmerge-all-constants</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATF"></A>
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.


<P>


This option implies <B>-fmerge-constants</B>.  In addition to
<B>-fmerge-constants</B> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
types.  Languages like C or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> require each non-automatic variable to
have distinct location, so using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.
<DT><B>-fmodulo-sched</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATG"></A>
Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
<DT><B>-fno-branch-count-reg</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATH"></A>
Do not use ``decrement and branch'' instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a

This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, <FONT SIZE="-1">IA-64</FONT> and S/390.


<P>


The default is <B>-fbranch-count-reg</B>.
<DT><B>-fno-function-cse</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATI"></A>
Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.


<P>


This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.


<P>


The default is <B>-ffunction-cse</B>
<DT><B>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATJ"></A>
If the target supports a <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> section, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT>.  This can save space in the resulting
code.


<P>


This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.


<P>


The default is <B>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</B>.
<DT><B>-fbounds-check</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATK"></A>
For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran front-ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.
<DT><B>-fmudflap -fmudflapth -fmudflapir</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATL"></A>
For front-ends that support it (C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (<I>libmudflap</I>), which will be linked into a program if
<B>-fmudflap</B> is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MUDFLAP_OPTIONS</B></FONT><B></B>
environment variable.  See <TT>&quot;env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out&quot;</TT>
for its options.


<P>


Use <B>-fmudflapth</B> instead of <B>-fmudflap</B> to compile and to
link if your program is multi-threaded.  Use <B>-fmudflapir</B>, in
addition to <B>-fmudflap</B> or <B>-fmudflapth</B>, if
instrumentation should ignore pointer reads.  This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still provides
some protection against outright memory corrupting writes, but allows
erroneously read data to propagate within a program.
<DT><B>-fthread-jumps</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATM"></A>
Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.

<A NAME="ixATN"></A>
In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> encounters an <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement with an
<TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> clause, <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> will follow the jump when the condition

<A NAME="ixATO"></A>
This is similar to <B>-fcse-follow-jumps</B>, but causes <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> to
follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT>
encounters a simple <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement with no else clause,

Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>

<DT><B>-fgcse-lm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATR"></A>
When <B>-fgcse-lm</B> is enabled, global common subexpression elimination will
attempt to move loads which are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.


<P>


Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.
<DT><B>-fgcse-sm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATS"></A>
When <B>-fgcse-sm</B> is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass will attempt to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with <B>-fgcse-lm</B>,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.


<P>


Not enabled at any optimization level.
<DT><B>-fgcse-las</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATT"></A>
When <B>-fgcse-las</B> is enabled, the global common subexpression

Not enabled at any optimization level.
<DT><B>-fgcse-after-reload</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATU"></A>
When <B>-fgcse-after-reload</B> is enabled, a redundant load elimination

redundant spilling.
<DT><B>-funsafe-loop-optimizations</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixATV"></A>
If given, the loop optimizer will assume that loop indices do not
overflow, and that the loops with nontrivial exit condition are not
infinite.  This enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if
the loop optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are valid.
Using <B>-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations</B>, the compiler will warn you
if it finds this kind of loop.
<DT><B>-fcrossjumping</B><DD>

<A NAME="ixATZ"></A>
Use global dataflow analysis to identify and eliminate useless checks
for null pointers.  The compiler assumes that dereferencing a null
pointer would have halted the program.  If a pointer is checked after
it has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.


<P>


In some environments, this assumption is not true, and programs can
safely dereference null pointers.  Use
<B>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</B> to disable this optimization

<A NAME="ixAUE"></A>
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to

<DT><B>-fsched2-use-superblocks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAUM"></A>
When scheduling after register allocation, do use superblock scheduling
algorithm.  Superblock scheduling allows motion across basic block boundaries
resulting on faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> model the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> closely enough to avoid unreliable

<DT><B>-ftree-loop-im</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVF"></A>
Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
would be hard to handle at <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With <B>-funswitch-loops</B> it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use

store motion.
<DT><B>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVG"></A>
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in the loop for that

<DT><B>-ftree-copyrename</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVJ"></A>
Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler

<DT><B>-ftree-ter</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVK"></A>
Perform temporary expression replacement during the <FONT SIZE="-1">SSA-</FONT>&gt;normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their

<DT><B>-ftree-vect-loop-version</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVN"></A>
Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.  When a loop

<DT><B>-ftree-vrp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVO"></A>
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is

<DT><B>-funroll-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVQ"></A>
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile

<B>-frerun-cse-after-loop</B>.  This option makes code larger,
and may or may not make it run faster.
<DT><B>-funroll-all-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVR"></A>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when

<DT><B>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVS"></A>
Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.


<P>


Combination of <B>-fweb</B> and <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> is often sufficient to obtain the

<DT><B>-freorder-blocks-and-partition</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAVZ"></A>
In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order
to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks
into separate sections of the assembly and .o files, to improve
paging and cache locality performance.


<P>


This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined
section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named
sections.
<DT><B>-freorder-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAWA"></A>
Reorder functions in the object file in order to
improve code locality.  This is implemented by using special
subsections <TT>&quot;.text.hot&quot;</TT> for most frequently executed functions and
<TT>&quot;.text.unlikely&quot;</TT> for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.


<P>


Also profile feedback must be available in to make this option effective.  See
<B>-fprofile-arcs</B> for details.

<DT><B>-fstrict-aliasing</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAWB"></A>
Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <TT>&quot;unsigned int&quot;</TT> can alias an <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>, but not a
<TT>&quot;void*&quot;</TT> or a <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>.  A character type may alias any other
type.


<P>


Pay special attention to code like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        union a_union {
          int i;
          double d;
        };
        
        int f() {
          a_union t;
          t.d = 3.0;
          return t.i;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called ``type-punning'') is common.  Even with
<B>-fstrict-aliasing</B>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  However, this code might not:


<P>




<PRE>
        int f() {
          a_union t;
          int* ip;
          t.d = 3.0;
          ip = &amp;t.i;
          return *ip;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis
should define a function that computes, given an <TT>&quot;tree&quot;</TT>
node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets are not
allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function
<TT>&quot;c_get_alias_set&quot;</TT>.

<DT><B>-fstrict-overflow</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAWC"></A>
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it will not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler will assume
that an expression like <TT>&quot;i + 10 &gt; i&quot;</TT> will always be true for
signed <TT>&quot;i&quot;</TT>.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if <TT>&quot;i + 10&quot;</TT> overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers will
overflow must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.


<P>


See also the <B>-fwrapv</B> option.  Using <B>-fwrapv</B> means
that signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
<B>-fwrapv</B> is used, there is no difference between
<B>-fstrict-overflow</B> and <B>-fno-strict-overflow</B>.  With
<B>-fwrapv</B> certain types of overflow are permitted.  For
example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing arithmetic on
constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
<B>-fwrapv</B>, but not otherwise.

<A NAME="ixAWE"></A>

Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than
<I>n</I>, skipping up to <I>n</I> bytes.  For instance,
<B>-falign-functions=32</B> aligns functions to the next 32-byte
boundary, but <B>-falign-functions=24</B> would align to the next
32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23 bytes or less.


<P>


<B>-fno-align-functions</B> and <B>-falign-functions=1</B> are

Some assemblers only support this flag when <I>n</I> is a power of two;
in that case, it is rounded up.

<A NAME="ixAWG"></A>

Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to

make code slower, because it must insert dummy operations for when the
branch target is reached in the usual flow of the code.


<P>


<B>-fno-align-labels</B> and <B>-falign-labels=1</B> are
equivalent and mean that labels will not be aligned.


<P>


If <B>-falign-loops</B> or <B>-falign-jumps</B> are applicable and
are greater than this value, then their values are used instead.

<DT><B>-funit-at-a-time</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAWP"></A>
Parse the whole compilation unit before starting to produce code.
This allows some extra optimizations to take place but consumes
more memory (in general).  There are some compatibility issues
with <I>unit-at-a-time</I> mode:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
enabling <I>unit-at-a-time</I> mode may change the order
in which functions, variables, and top-level <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> statements
are emitted, and will likely break code relying on some particular
ordering.  The majority of such top-level <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> statements,
though, can be replaced by <TT>&quot;section&quot;</TT> attributes.  The
<B>fno-toplevel-reorder</B> option may be used to keep the ordering
used in the input file, at the cost of some optimizations.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>unit-at-a-time</I> mode removes unreferenced static variables
and functions.  This may result in undefined references
when an <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> statement refers directly to variables or functions
that are otherwise unused.  In that case either the variable/function
shall be listed as an operand of the <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> statement operand or,
in the case of top-level <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> statements the attribute <TT>&quot;used&quot;</TT>
shall be used on the declaration.
<DT>*<DD>
Static functions now can use non-standard passing conventions that
may break <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> statements calling functions directly.  Again,
attribute <TT>&quot;used&quot;</TT> will prevent this behavior.

Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT>
statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear in the
input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static variables
will not be removed.  This option is intended to support existing code
which relies on a particular ordering.  For new code, it is better to
use attributes.
<DT><B>-fweb</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAWR"></A>
Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT>, loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a
``home register''.


<P>


Enabled by default with <B>-funroll-loops</B>.

Assume that the current compilation unit represents whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>
and those merged by attribute <TT>&quot;externally_visible&quot;</TT> become static functions
and in a affect gets more aggressively optimized by interprocedural optimizers.
While this option is equivalent to proper use of <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> keyword for
programs consisting of single file, in combination with option
<B>--combine</B> this flag can be used to compile most of smaller scale C
programs since the functions and variables become local for the whole combined
compilation unit, not for the single source file itself.
<DT><B>-fno-cprop-registers</B><DD>

<A NAME="ixAWW"></A>
Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other

<P>


This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> floating

Do not set <FONT SIZE="-1">ERRNO</FONT> after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., sqrt.  A program that relies on

On Darwin systems, the math library never sets <TT>&quot;errno&quot;</TT>.  There is therefore

The default is <B>-ftrapping-math</B>.
<DT><B>-frounding-math</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXC"></A>
Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating
point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating point expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.

<A NAME="ixAXD"></A>
It is a size optimization method. This option is to find identical

<A NAME="ixAXE"></A>
Compile code assuming that <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> signaling NaNs may generate user-visible

<A NAME="ixAXI"></A>
After running a program compiled with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, you can compile it a second time using
<B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <I>sourcename.gcda</I> for each source
file  The information in this data file is very dependent on the

<A NAME="ixAXK"></A>
If combined with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, it instructs the compiler to add

Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operation
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.
<DT><B>-frename-registers</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXL"></A>
Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
will most benefit processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can

Enabled by default with <B>-funroll-loops</B>.
<DT><B>-ftracer</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXM"></A>
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation

better job.


<P>


Enabled with <B>-fprofile-use</B>.
<DT><B>-funroll-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXN"></A>
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  <B>-funroll-loops</B> implies
<B>-frerun-cse-after-loop</B>, <B>-fweb</B> and <B>-frename-registers</B>. 
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with

<P>


Enabled with <B>-fprofile-use</B>.
<DT><B>-funroll-all-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXO"></A>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when

<DT><B>-fpeel-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXP"></A>
Peels the loops for that there is enough information that they do not

<A NAME="ixAXT"></A>

Place each function or data item into its own section in the output

<P>


Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> object format and <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT> processors running Solaris 2 have

Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower.
You will not be able to use <TT>&quot;gprof&quot;</TT> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and <B>-g</B>.
<DT><B>-fbranch-target-load-optimize</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXU"></A>
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading.
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.
<DT><B>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXV"></A>
Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue
threading.
<DT><B>-fbtr-bb-exclusive</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXW"></A>
When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse
branch target registers in within any basic block.
<DT><B>-fstack-protector</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXX"></A>
Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call alloca, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
<DT><B>-fstack-protector-all</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXY"></A>
Like <B>-fstack-protector</B> except that all functions are protected.
<DT><B>-fsection-anchors</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAXZ"></A>
Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared ``anchor'' symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries and <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> accesses on some
targets.


<P>


For example, the implementation of the following function <TT>&quot;foo&quot;</TT>:


<P>




<PRE>
        static int a, b, c;
        int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }

</PRE>




<P>


would usually calculate the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <B>-fsection-anchors</B>, it will access the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):


<P>




<PRE>
        int foo (void)
        {
          register int *xr = &amp;x;
          return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];
        }

</PRE>




<P>


Not all targets support this option.
<DT><B>--param</B> <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>value</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYA"></A>
In some places, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will not inline functions
that contain more that a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using the
<B>--param</B> option.


<P>


The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.


<P>


In each case, the <I>value</I> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<I>name</I> are given in the following table:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>salias-max-implicit-fields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYB"></A>
The maximum number of fields in a variable without direct
structure accesses for which structure aliasing will consider trying 
to track each field.  The default is 5
<DT><B>salias-max-array-elements</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYC"></A>
The maximum number of elements an array can have and its elements
still be tracked individually by structure aliasing. The default is 4
<DT><B>sra-max-structure-size</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYD"></A>
The maximum structure size, in bytes, at which the scalar replacement
of aggregates (<FONT SIZE="-1">SRA</FONT>) optimization will perform block copies.  The
default value, 0, implies that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will select the most appropriate
size itself.
<DT><B>sra-field-structure-ratio</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYE"></A>
The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between instantiated fields and
the complete structure size.  We say that if the ratio of the number
of bytes in instantiated fields to the number of bytes in the complete
structure exceeds this parameter, then block copies are not used.  The
default is 75.
<DT><B>max-crossjump-edges</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYF"></A>
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by <B>-fcrossjumping</B> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
<DT><B>min-crossjump-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYG"></A>
The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.
<DT><B>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYH"></A>
The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.
<DT><B>max-goto-duplication-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYI"></A>
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
<DT><B>max-delay-slot-insn-search</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYJ"></A>
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.
<DT><B>max-delay-slot-live-search</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYK"></A>
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
<DT><B>max-gcse-memory</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYL"></A>
The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.
<DT><B>max-gcse-passes</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYM"></A>
The maximum number of passes of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCSE</FONT> to run.  The default is 1.
<DT><B>max-pending-list-length</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYN"></A>
The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.
<DT><B>max-inline-insns-single</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYO"></A>
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>).
The default value is 450.
<DT><B>max-inline-insns-auto</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYP"></A>
When you use <B>-finline-functions</B> (included in <B>-O3</B>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 90.
<DT><B>large-function-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYQ"></A>
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining inlining is constrained by
<B>--param large-function-growth</B>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
backend.
This parameter is ignored when <B>-funit-at-a-time</B> is not used.
The default value is 2700.
<DT><B>large-function-growth</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYR"></A>
Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
This parameter is ignored when <B>-funit-at-a-time</B> is not used.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
<DT><B>large-unit-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYS"></A>
The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by <B>--param inline-unit-growth</B>.
For small units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlininable functions however the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <B>--param large-unit-insns</B>
before applying <B>--param inline-unit-growth</B>.  The default is 10000
<DT><B>inline-unit-growth</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYT"></A>
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
This parameter is ignored when <B>-funit-at-a-time</B> is not used.
The default value is 50 which limits unit growth to 1.5 times the original
size.
<DT><B>max-inline-insns-recursive</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYU"></A>

<DT><B>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYV"></A>

Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.


<P>


For functions declared inline <B>--param max-inline-insns-recursive</B> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <B>-finline-functions</B> (included in <B>-O3</B>) is
enabled and <B>--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</B> is used.  The
default value is 450.
<DT><B>max-inline-recursive-depth</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYW"></A>

<DT><B>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYX"></A>

Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive inlining.


<P>


For functions declared inline <B>--param max-inline-recursive-depth</B> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <B>-finline-functions</B> (included in <B>-O3</B>) is
enabled and <B>--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</B> is used.  The
default value is 450.
<DT><B>min-inline-recursive-probability</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYY"></A>
Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.


<P>


When profile feedback is available (see <B>-fprofile-generate</B>) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function will recurse via
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expression
whose probability exceeds given threshold (in percents).  The default value is
10.
<DT><B>inline-call-cost</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAYZ"></A>
Specify cost of call instruction relative to simple arithmetics operations
(having cost of 1).  Increasing this cost disqualifies inlining of non-leaf
functions and at the same time increases size of leaf function that is believed to
reduce function size by being inlined.  In effect it increases amount of
inlining for code having large abstraction penalty (many functions that just
pass the arguments to other functions) and decrease inlining for code with low
abstraction penalty.  The default value is 16.
<DT><B>max-unrolled-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZA"></A>
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.
<DT><B>max-average-unrolled-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZB"></A>
The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled,
it determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.
<DT><B>max-unroll-times</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZC"></A>
The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.
<DT><B>max-peeled-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZD"></A>
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.
<DT><B>max-peel-times</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZE"></A>
The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.
<DT><B>max-completely-peeled-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZF"></A>
The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.
<DT><B>max-completely-peel-times</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZG"></A>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.
<DT><B>max-unswitch-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZH"></A>
The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.
<DT><B>max-unswitch-level</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZI"></A>
The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.
<DT><B>lim-expensive</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZJ"></A>
The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.
<DT><B>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZK"></A>
Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below that
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  Only the most relevant candidates are considered
if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic time complexity.
<DT><B>iv-max-considered-uses</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZL"></A>
The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.
<DT><B>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZM"></A>
If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
we always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set during its
optimization when a new iv is added to the set.
<DT><B>scev-max-expr-size</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZN"></A>
Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer.
Large expressions slow the analyzer.
<DT><B>vect-max-version-checks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZO"></A>
The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed when doing
loop versioning in the vectorizer.  See option ftree-vect-loop-version
for more information.
<DT><B>max-iterations-to-track</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZP"></A>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute force algorithm
for analysis of # of iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.
<DT><B>hot-bb-count-fraction</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZQ"></A>
Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic block in program
given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.
<DT><B>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZR"></A>
Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot
<DT><B>max-predicted-iterations</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZS"></A>
The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where function contain single loop with known bound and other loop
with unknown.  We predict the known number of iterations correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds would appear artificially cold relative to the other one.
<DT><B>tracer-dynamic-coverage</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZT"></A>

<DT><B>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZU"></A>

This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.


<P>


The <B>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</B> is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.
<DT><B>tracer-max-code-growth</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZV"></A>
Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.
<DT><B>tracer-min-branch-ratio</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZW"></A>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).
<DT><B>tracer-min-branch-ratio</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZX"></A>

<DT><B>tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZY"></A>

Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this
threshold.


<P>


Similarly to <B>tracer-dynamic-coverage</B> two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.
<DT><B>max-cse-path-length</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAZZ"></A>
Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.  The default is 10.
<DT><B>max-cse-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAA"></A>
The maximum instructions <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> process before flushing. The default is 1000.
<DT><B>global-var-threshold</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAB"></A>
Counts the number of function calls (<I>n</I>) and the number of
call-clobbered variables (<I>v</I>).  If <I>n</I>x<I>v</I> is larger than this limit, a
single artificial variable will be created to represent all the
call-clobbered variables at function call sites.  This artificial
variable will then be made to alias every call-clobbered variable.
(done as <TT>&quot;int * size_t&quot;</TT> on the host machine; beware overflow).
<DT><B>max-aliased-vops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAC"></A>
Maximum number of virtual operands allowed to represent aliases
before triggering the alias grouping heuristic.  Alias grouping
reduces compile times and memory consumption needed for aliasing at
the expense of precision loss in alias information.
<DT><B>ggc-min-expand</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAD"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.


<P>


The default is 30% + 70% * (<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM/1GB</FONT>) with an upper bound of 100% when
<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> &gt;= 1GB.  If <TT>&quot;getrlimit&quot;</TT> is available, the notion of ``<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT>'' is
the smallest of actual <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> and <TT>&quot;RLIMIT_DATA&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;RLIMIT_AS&quot;</TT>.  If
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is not able to calculate <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<B>ggc-min-heapsize</B> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
<DT><B>ggc-min-heapsize</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAE"></A>
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <B>ggc-min-expand</B>% beyond <B>ggc-min-heapsize</B>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.


<P>


The default is the smaller of <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM/8</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_RSS</FONT>, or a limit which
tries to ensure that <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_DATA</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_AS</FONT> are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is not able to calculate <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and <B>ggc-min-expand</B> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.
<DT><B>max-reload-search-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAF"></A>
The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the
compile time increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default
value is 100.
<DT><B>max-cselib-memory-locations</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAG"></A>
The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into account.
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time
increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default value is 500.
<DT><B>max-flow-memory-locations</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAH"></A>
Similar as <B>max-cselib-memory-locations</B> but for dataflow liveness.
The default value is 100.
<DT><B>reorder-blocks-duplicate</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAI"></A>

<DT><B>reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAJ"></A>

Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional
branch or duplicate the code on its destination.  Code is duplicated when its
estimated size is smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.


<P>


The <B>reorder-block-duplicate-feedback</B> is used only when profile
feedback is available and may be set to higher values than
<B>reorder-block-duplicate</B> since information about the hot spots is more
accurate.
<DT><B>max-sched-ready-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAK"></A>
The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should
consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
with probably little benefit.  The default value is 100.
<DT><B>max-sched-region-blocks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAL"></A>
The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 10.
<DT><B>max-sched-region-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAM"></A>
The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 100.
<DT><B>min-spec-prob</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAN"></A>
The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source block
for interblock speculative scheduling.  The default value is 40.
<DT><B>max-sched-extend-regions-iters</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAO"></A>
The maximum number of iterations through <FONT SIZE="-1">CFG</FONT> to extend regions.
0 - disable region extension,
N - do at most N iterations.
The default value is 0.
<DT><B>max-sched-insn-conflict-delay</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAP"></A>
The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered for speculative motion.
The default value is 3.
<DT><B>sched-spec-prob-cutoff</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAQ"></A>
The minimal probability of speculation success (in percents), so that
speculative insn will be scheduled.
The default value is 40.
<DT><B>max-last-value-rtl</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAR"></A>
The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression
in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.  The default
is 10000.
<DT><B>integer-share-limit</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAS"></A>
Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the
compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum
value of a shared integer constant's.  The default value is 256.
<DT><B>min-virtual-mappings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAT"></A>
Specifies the minimum number of virtual mappings in the incremental
<FONT SIZE="-1">SSA</FONT> updater that should be registered to trigger the virtual mappings
heuristic defined by virtual-mappings-ratio.  The default value is
100.
<DT><B>virtual-mappings-ratio</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAU"></A>
If the number of virtual mappings is virtual-mappings-ratio bigger
than the number of virtual symbols to be updated, then the incremental
<FONT SIZE="-1">SSA</FONT> updater switches to a full update for those symbols.  The default
ratio is 3.
<DT><B>ssp-buffer-size</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAV"></A>
The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive stack smashing
protection when <B>-fstack-protection</B> is used.
<DT><B>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAW"></A>
Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be
duplicated when threading jumps.
<DT><B>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBAX"></A>
Maximum number of fields in a structure we will treat in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.

<H2>Options Controlling the Preprocessor</H2>

<A NAME="ixBAY"></A>
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
<P>

If you use the <B>-E</B> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with <B>-E</B> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual

<A NAME="ixBAZ"></A>
You can use <B>-Wp,</B><I>option</I> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <I>option</I> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
<I>option</I> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
<B>-Wp</B> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct

If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<B>-Xpreprocessor</B> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
<DT><B>-D</B> <I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBB"></A>
Predefine <I>name</I> as a macro, with definition <TT>1</TT>.
<DT><B>-D</B> <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>definition</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBC"></A>
The contents of <I>definition</I> are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a <B>#define</B>
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.


<P>


If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.


<P>


If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With <B>sh</B> and <B>csh</B>,
<B>-D'</B><I>name</I><B>(</B><I>args...</I><B>)=</B><I>definition</I><B>'</B> works.


<P>


<B>-D</B> and <B>-U</B> options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All <B>-imacros</B> <I>file</I> and
<B>-include</B> <I>file</I> options are processed after all
<B>-D</B> and <B>-U</B> options.
<DT><B>-U</B> <I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBD"></A>
Cancel any previous definition of <I>name</I>, either built in or
provided with a <B>-D</B> option.
<DT><B>-undef</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBE"></A>
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
<DT><B>-I</B> <I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBF"></A>
Add the directory <I>dir</I> to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by <B>-I</B> are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory <I>dir</I> is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
.
<DT><B>-o</B> <I>file</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBG"></A>
Write output to <I>file</I>.  This is the same as specifying <I>file</I>
as the second non-option argument to <B>cpp</B>.  <B>gcc</B> has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use <B>-o</B> to specify the output file.
<DT><B>-Wall</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBH"></A>
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is <B>-Wcomment</B>, <B>-Wtrigraphs</B>,
<B>-Wmultichar</B> and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in <TT>&quot;#if&quot;</TT> expressions.  Note that many of the
preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
control them.
<DT><B>-Wcomment</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBI"></A>

<DT><B>-Wcomments</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBJ"></A>

Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <B>/*</B> appears in a <B>/*</B>
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a <B>//</B> comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)
<DT><B>-Wtrigraphs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBK"></A>
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (<B>??/</B> at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.


<P>


This option is implied by <B>-Wall</B>.  If <B>-Wall</B> is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
<B>-Wall</B> warnings, use <B>-trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs</B>.
<DT><B>-Wtraditional</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBL"></A>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C.  Also warn about <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.
<DT><B>-Wimport</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBM"></A>
Warn the first time <B>#import</B> is used.
<DT><B>-Wundef</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBN"></A>
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
<B>#if</B> directive, outside of <B>defined</B>.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
<DT><B>-Wunused-macros</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBO"></A>
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is <I>used</I> if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.


<P>


Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:


<P>




<PRE>
        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
        #endif

</PRE>


<DT><B>-Wendif-labels</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBP"></A>
Warn whenever an <B>#else</B> or an <B>#endif</B> are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form


<P>




<PRE>
        #if FOO
        ...
        #else FOO
        ...
        #endif FOO

</PRE>




<P>


The second and third <TT>&quot;FOO&quot;</TT> should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.
<DT><B>-Werror</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBQ"></A>
Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
<DT><B>-Wsystem-headers</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBR"></A>
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
<DT><B>-w</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBS"></A>
Suppress all warnings, including those which <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> issues by default.
<DT><B>-pedantic</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBT"></A>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
<DT><B>-pedantic-errors</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBU"></A>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> issues
without <B>-pedantic</B> but treats as warnings.
<DT><B>-M</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBV"></A>
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <B>make</B> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <B>make</B> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from <B>-include</B> or
<B>-imacros</B> command line options.


<P>


Unless specified explicitly (with <B>-MT</B> or <B>-MQ</B>), the
object file name consists of the basename of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix.  If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using <B>\</B>-newline.
The rule has no commands.


<P>


This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
<B>-dM</B>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
<B>-MF</B>, or use an environment variable like
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></FONT><B></B>.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.


<P>


Passing <B>-M</B> to the driver implies <B>-E</B>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit <B>-w</B>.
<DT><B>-MM</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBW"></A>
Like <B>-M</B> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.


<P>


This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
<B>#include</B> directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in <B>-MM</B> dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> versions 3.0 and earlier.
<DT><B>-MF</B> <I>file</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBX"></A>
When used with <B>-M</B> or <B>-MM</B>, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no <B>-MF</B> switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.


<P>


When used with the driver options <B>-MD</B> or <B>-MMD</B>,
<B>-MF</B> overrides the default dependency output file.
<DT><B>-dependency-file</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBY"></A>
Like <B>-MF</B>. (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)
<DT><B>-MG</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBBZ"></A>
In conjunction with an option such as <B>-M</B> requesting
dependency generation, <B>-MG</B> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<TT>&quot;#include&quot;</TT> directive without prepending any path.  <B>-MG</B>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.


<P>


This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
<DT><B>-MP</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCA"></A>
This option instructs <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors <B>make</B> gives if you remove header
files without updating the <I>Makefile</I> to match.


<P>


This is typical output:


<P>




<PRE>
        test.o: test.c test.h
        
        test.h:

</PRE>


<DT><B>-MT</B> <I>target</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCB"></A>
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> takes the name of the main input file, including any path,
deletes any file suffix such as <B>.c</B>, and appends the platform's
usual object suffix.  The result is the target.


<P>


An <B>-MT</B> option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <B>-MT</B>, or use multiple <B>-MT</B> options.


<P>


For example, <B>-MT&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</B> might give


<P>




<PRE>
        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

</PRE>


<DT><B>-MQ</B> <I>target</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCC"></A>
Same as <B>-MT</B>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  <B>-MQ&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</B> gives


<P>




<PRE>
        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

</PRE>




<P>


The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<B>-MQ</B>.
<DT><B>-MD</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCD"></A>
<B>-MD</B> is equivalent to <B>-M -MF</B> <I>file</I>, except that
<B>-E</B> is not implied.  The driver determines <I>file</I> based on
whether an <B>-o</B> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of <I>.d</I>, otherwise it take the
basename of the input file and applies a <I>.d</I> suffix.


<P>


If <B>-MD</B> is used in conjunction with <B>-E</B>, any
<B>-o</B> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without <B>-E</B>, each <B>-o</B>
is understood to specify a target object file.


<P>


Since <B>-E</B> is not implied, <B>-MD</B> can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
<DT><B>-MMD</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCE"></A>
Like <B>-MD</B> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
<DT><B>-fpch-deps</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCF"></A>
When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
<DT><B>-fpch-preprocess</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCG"></A>
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with <B>-E</B>.  It inserts a special <TT>&quot;#pragma&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;#pragma GCC pch_preprocess &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot;&quot;</TT> in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its filename.  When
<B>-fpreprocessed</B> is in use, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> recognizes this <TT>&quot;#pragma&quot;</TT> and
loads the <FONT SIZE="-1">PCH</FONT>.


<P>


This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.  It is switched on by
<B>-save-temps</B>.


<P>


You should not write this <TT>&quot;#pragma&quot;</TT> in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the <FONT SIZE="-1">PCH</FONT> file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s
current directory.
<DT><B>-x c</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCH"></A>

<DT><B>-x c++</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCI"></A>
<DT><B>-x objective-c</B><DD>

<DT><B>-x objective-c++</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCK"></A>
<DT><B>-x assembler-with-cpp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCL"></A>

Specify the source language: C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C, Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
<B>.c</B>, <B>.cc</B>, <B>.m</B>, <B>.mm</B>, or <B>.S</B>.  Some other common
extensions for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> Previous versions of cpp accepted a <B>-lang</B> option
which selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the <B>-l</B>
option.
<DT><B>-std=</B><I>standard</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCM"></A>

<DT><B>-ansi</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBCN"></A>

Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT>
knows about C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standards; others may be added in the future.

</DL>

<DT><B>-I-</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDA"></A>
Split the include path.  Any directories specified with <B>-I</B>
options before <B>-I-</B> are searched only for headers requested with
<TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&quot;</TT>file<TT>&quot;&quot;</TT>; they are not searched for
<TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&lt;</TT>file<TT>&gt;&quot;</TT>.  If additional directories are
specified with <B>-I</B> options after the <B>-I-</B>, those
directories are searched for all <B>#include</B> directives.


<P>


In addition, <B>-I-</B> inhibits the use of the directory of the current
file directory as the first search directory for <TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&quot;</TT>file<TT>&quot;&quot;</TT>.
This option has been deprecated.
<DT><B>-nostdinc</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDB"></A>
Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
Only the directories you have specified with <B>-I</B> options
(and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.
<DT><B>-nostdinc++</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDC"></A>
Do not search for header files in the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option is
used when building the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.)
<DT><B>-include</B> <I>file</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDD"></A>
Process <I>file</I> as if <TT>&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;</TT> appeared as the first
line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
for <I>file</I> is the preprocessor's working directory <I>instead of</I>
the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
is searched for in the remainder of the <TT>&quot;#include &quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT> search
chain as normal.


<P>


If multiple <B>-include</B> options are given, the files are included
in the order they appear on the command line.
<DT><B>-imacros</B> <I>file</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDE"></A>
Exactly like <B>-include</B>, except that any output produced by
scanning <I>file</I> is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
processing its declarations.


<P>


All files specified by <B>-imacros</B> are processed before all files
specified by <B>-include</B>.
<DT><B>-idirafter</B> <I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDF"></A>
Search <I>dir</I> for header files, but do it <I>after</I> all
directories specified with <B>-I</B> and the standard system directories
have been exhausted.  <I>dir</I> is treated as a system include directory.
<DT><B>-iprefix</B> <I>prefix</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDG"></A>
Specify <I>prefix</I> as the prefix for subsequent <B>-iwithprefix</B>
options.  If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the
final <B>/</B>.
<DT><B>-iwithprefix</B> <I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDH"></A>

<DT><B>-iwithprefixbefore</B> <I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDI"></A>

Append <I>dir</I> to the prefix specified previously with
<B>-iprefix</B>, and add the resulting directory to the include search
path.  <B>-iwithprefixbefore</B> puts it in the same place <B>-I</B>
would; <B>-iwithprefix</B> puts it where <B>-idirafter</B> would.
<DT><B>-isysroot</B> <I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDJ"></A>
This option is like the <B>--sysroot</B> option, but applies only to
header files.  See the <B>--sysroot</B> option for more information.
<DT><B>-imultilib</B> <I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDK"></A>
Use <I>dir</I> as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> headers.
<DT><B>-isystem</B> <I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDL"></A>
Search <I>dir</I> for header files, after all directories specified by
<B>-I</B> but before the standard system directories.  Mark it
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as
is applied to the standard system directories.
<DT><B>-iquote</B> <I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDM"></A>
Search <I>dir</I> only for header files requested with
<TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&quot;</TT>file<TT>&quot;&quot;</TT>; they are not searched for
<TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&lt;</TT>file<TT>&gt;&quot;</TT>, before all directories specified by
<B>-I</B> and before the standard system directories.
<DT><B>-fdollars-in-identifiers</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDN"></A>
Accept <B>$</B> in identifiers.
<DT><B>-fextended-identifiers</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDO"></A>
Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
experimental; in a future version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>, it will be enabled by
default for C99 and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT><B>-fpreprocessed</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDP"></A>
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with <B>-C</B> to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.


<P>


<B>-fpreprocessed</B> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions <B>.i</B>, <B>.ii</B> or <B>.mi</B>.  These are the
extensions that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses for preprocessed files created by
<B>-save-temps</B>.
<DT><B>-ftabstop=</B><I>width</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDQ"></A>
Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.
<DT><B>-fexec-charset=</B><I>charset</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDR"></A>
Set the execution character set, used for string and character
constants.  The default is <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.  <I>charset</I> can be any encoding
supported by the system's <TT>&quot;iconv&quot;</TT> library routine.
<DT><B>-fwide-exec-charset=</B><I>charset</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDS"></A>
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-32</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT>, whichever
corresponds to the width of <TT>&quot;wchar_t&quot;</TT>.  As with
<B>-fexec-charset</B>, <I>charset</I> can be any encoding supported
by the system's <TT>&quot;iconv&quot;</TT> library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in <TT>&quot;wchar_t&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-finput-charset=</B><I>charset</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDT"></A>
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.  If the
locale does not specify, or <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  <I>charset</I> can be any encoding
supported by the system's <TT>&quot;iconv&quot;</TT> library routine.
<DT><B>-fworking-directory</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDU"></A>
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form <B>-fno-working-directory</B>.  If the <B>-P</B> flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
<TT>&quot;#line&quot;</TT> directives are emitted whatsoever.
<DT><B>-fno-show-column</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBDV"></A>
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if

<A NAME="ixBDZ"></A>
Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <B>#define</B>
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file <I>foo.h</I>, the command


<P>




<PRE>
        touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

</PRE>




<P>


will show all the predefined macros.

If you use <B>-dM</B> without the <B>-E</B> option, <B>-dM</B> is

<DT><B>-C</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBEE"></A>
Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.


<P>


You should be prepared for side effects when using <B>-C</B>; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a <B>#</B>.
<DT><B>-CC</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBEF"></A>
Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like <B>-C</B>, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.


<P>


In addition to the side-effects of the <B>-C</B> option, the
<B>-CC</B> option causes all C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.

The <B>-CC</B> option is generally used to support lint comments.

These are three-character sequences, all starting with <B>??</B>, that
are defined by <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C to stand for single characters.  For example,
<B>??/</B> stands for <B>\</B>, so <B>'??/n'</B> is a character
constant for a newline.  By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the <B>-std</B> and

<H2>Options for Linking</H2>

<A NAME="ixBES"></A>
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
<P>

In addition to the options listed below, Apple's <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> also accepts and
passes nearly all of the options defined by the linker <B>ld</B> and by
the library tool <B>libtool</B>.  Common options include
<B>-framework</B>, <B>-dynamic</B>, <B>-bundle</B>,
<B>-flat_namespace</B>, and so forth.  See the ld and libtool man pages
for further details.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>object-file-name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBET"></A>
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.
<DT><B>-c</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBEU"></A>

<DT><B>-S</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBEV"></A>
<DT><B>-E</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBEW"></A>

If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.
<DT><B>-l</B><I>library</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBEX"></A>

<DT><B>-l</B> <I>library</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBEY"></A>

Search the library named <I>library</I> when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> compliance and is not recommended.)


<P>


It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, <B>foo.o -lz bar.o</B> searches library <B>z</B>
after file <I>foo.o</I> but before <I>bar.o</I>.  If <I>bar.o</I> refers
to functions in <B>z</B>, those functions may not be loaded.


<P>


The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named <I>liblibrary.a</I>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.


<P>


The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <B>-L</B>.


<P>


Normally the files found this way are library files---archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <B>-l</B> option and specifying a file name
is that <B>-l</B> surrounds <I>library</I> with <B>lib</B> and <B>.a</B>
and searches several directories.
<DT><B>-lobjc</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBEZ"></A>
You need this special case of the <B>-l</B> option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> program.
<DT><B>-nostartfiles</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFA"></A>
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless <B>-nostdlib</B>
or <B>-nodefaultlibs</B> is used.
<DT><B>-nodefaultlibs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFB"></A>
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker.
The standard startup files are used normally, unless <B>-nostartfiles</B>
is used.  The compiler may generate calls to <TT>&quot;memcmp&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;memmove&quot;</TT>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
<DT><B>-nostdlib</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFC"></A>
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify will be passed to
the linker.  The compiler may generate calls to <TT>&quot;memcmp&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;memmove&quot;</TT>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.


<P>


One of the standard libraries bypassed by <B>-nostdlib</B> and
<B>-nodefaultlibs</B> is <I>libgcc.a</I>, a library of internal subroutines
that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.


<P>


In most cases, you need <I>libgcc.a</I> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <B>-nostdlib</B>
or <B>-nodefaultlibs</B> you should usually specify <B>-lgcc</B> as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
library subroutines.  (For example, <B>__main</B>, used to ensure C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
constructors will be called.)
<DT><B>-pie</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFD"></A>
Produce a position independent executable on targets which support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
that were used to generate code (<B>-fpie</B>, <B>-fPIE</B>,
or model suboptions) when you specify this option.
<DT><B>-rdynamic</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFE"></A>
Pass the flag <B>-export-dynamic</B> to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of <TT>&quot;dlopen&quot;</TT> or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFF"></A>
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
<DT><B>-static</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFG"></A>
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.


<P>


This option will not work on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X unless all libraries (including
<I>libgcc.a</I>) have also been compiled with <B>-static</B>.  Since
neither a static version of libSystem.dylib nor crt0.o are provided, this
option is not useful to most people.
<DT><B>-shared</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFH"></A>
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options that were used to
generate code (<B>-fpic</B>, <B>-fPIC</B>, or model suboptions)
when you specify this option.[1]


<P>


This option is not supported on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X.
<DT><B>-shared-libgcc</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFI"></A>

<DT><B>-static-libgcc</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFJ"></A>

On systems that provide <I>libgcc</I> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version respectively.
If no shared version of <I>libgcc</I> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.


<P>


There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared <I>libgcc</I> instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared <I>libgcc</I>.


<P>


Therefore, the G++ and <FONT SIZE="-1">GCJ</FONT> drivers automatically add
<B>-shared-libgcc</B> whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.


<P>


If, instead, you use the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they will not always be linked with the shared <I>libgcc</I>.
If <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker that does not support option <B>--eh-frame-hdr</B>,
it will link the shared version of <I>libgcc</I> into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it will take advantage of the linker and optimize
away the linking with the shared version of <I>libgcc</I>, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.


<P>


However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or <FONT SIZE="-1">GCJ</FONT> driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
<B>-shared-libgcc</B>, such that it is linked with the shared
<I>libgcc</I>.
<DT><B>-symbolic</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFK"></A>
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option <B>-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs</B>).  Only a few systems support
this option.
<DT><B>-Xlinker</B> <I>option</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFL"></A>
Pass <I>option</I> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options which <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not know how to
recognize.


<P>


If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<B>-Xlinker</B> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass <B>-assert definitions</B>, you must write
<B>-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</B>.  It does not work to write
<B>-Xlinker ``-assert definitions''</B>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
<DT><B>-Wl,</B><I>option</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFM"></A>
Pass <I>option</I> as an option to the linker.  If <I>option</I> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
<DT><B>-u</B> <I>symbol</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFN"></A>
Pretend the symbol <I>symbol</I> is undefined, to force linking of

different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options for Directory Search</H2>

<A NAME="ixBFO"></A>
These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-I</B><I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFP"></A>
Add the directory <I>dir</I> to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use <B>-isystem</B> for that).  If you use more than
one <B>-I</B> option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.


<P>


If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<B>-isystem</B>, is also specified with <B>-I</B>, the <B>-I</B>
option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the <B>-nostdinc</B> and/or <B>-isystem</B> options.


<P>


The option <B>-iwithsysroot</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>), if specified with an
absolute path, will prepend the system root directory (if applicable) to
the path and add it to the beginning of the system search paths.  If
specified with a relative path, <B>-iwithsysroot</B> will behave
identically to <B>-isystem</B>.
<DT><B>-iquote</B><I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFQ"></A>
Add the directory <I>dir</I> to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of <B>#include
&quot;</B><I>file</I><B>&quot;</B>; they are not searched for <B>#include &lt;</B><I>file</I><B>&gt;</B>,
otherwise just like <B>-I</B>.
<DT><B>-L</B><I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFR"></A>
Add directory <I>dir</I> to the list of directories to be searched
for <B>-l</B>.
<DT><B>-B</B><I>prefix</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFS"></A>
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.


<P>


The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<I>cpp</I>, <I>cc1</I>, <I>as</I> and <I>ld</I>.  It tries
<I>prefix</I> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without <I>machine</I><B>/</B><I>version</I><B>/</B>.


<P>


For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<B>-B</B> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <B>-B</B>
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
<I>/usr/lib/gcc/</I> and <I>/usr/local/lib/gcc/</I>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable.


<P>


The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the <B>-B</B>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
separator character at the end of the path.


<P>


<B>-B</B> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <B>-L</B> options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into <B>-isystem</B> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends <B>include</B> to the prefix.


<P>


The run-time support file <I>libgcc.a</I> can also be searched for using
the <B>-B</B> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.


<P>


Another way to specify a prefix much like the <B>-B</B> prefix is to use
the environment variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.


<P>


As a special kludge, if the path provided by <B>-B</B> is
<I>[dir/]stageN/</I>, where <I>N</I> is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it will be replaced by <I>[dir/]include</I>.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
<DT><B>-specs=</B><I>file</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFT"></A>
Process <I>file</I> after the compiler reads in the standard <I>specs</I>
file, in order to override the defaults that the <I>gcc</I> driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to <I>cc1</I>,
<I>cc1plus</I>, <I>as</I>, <I>ld</I>, etc.  More than one
<B>-specs=</B><I>file</I> can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
<DT><B>--sysroot=</B><I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFU"></A>
Use <I>dir</I> as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler would normally search for headers in
<I>/usr/include</I> and libraries in <I>/usr/lib</I>, it will instead
search <I>dir/usr/include</I> and <I>dir/usr/lib</I>.


<P>


If you use both this option and the <B>-isysroot</B> option, then
the <B>--sysroot</B> option will apply to libraries, but the
<B>-isysroot</B> option will apply to header files.


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of <B>--sysroot</B> will still work, but the
library aspect will not.
<DT><B>-I-</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFV"></A>
This option has been deprecated.  Please use <B>-iquote</B> instead for
<B>-I</B> directories before the <B>-I-</B> and remove the <B>-I-</B>.
Any directories you specify with <B>-I</B> options before the <B>-I-</B>
option are searched only for the case of <B>#include &quot;</B><I>file</I><B>&quot;</B>;
they are not searched for <B>#include &lt;</B><I>file</I><B>&gt;</B>.


<P>


If additional directories are specified with <B>-I</B> options after
the <B>-I-</B>, these directories are searched for all <B>#include</B>
directives.  (Ordinarily <I>all</I> <B>-I</B> directories are used
this way.)


<P>


In addition, the <B>-I-</B> option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for <B>#include &quot;</B><I>file</I><B>&quot;</B>.  There is no way to
override this effect of <B>-I-</B>.  With <B>-I.</B> you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.


<P>


<B>-I-</B> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, <B>-I-</B> and <B>-nostdinc</B> are
independent.

<H2>Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version</H2>

<A NAME="ixBFW"></A>
The usual way to run <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is to run the executable called <I>gcc</I>, or
<I>&lt;machine&gt;-gcc</I> when cross-compiling, or
<I>&lt;machine&gt;-gcc-&lt;version&gt;</I> to run a version other than the one that
was installed last.  Sometimes this is inconvenient, so <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> provides
options that will switch to another cross-compiler or version.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b</B> <I>machine</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFX"></A>
The argument <I>machine</I> specifies the target machine for compilation.


<P>


The value to use for <I>machine</I> is the same as was specified as the
machine type when configuring <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> as a cross-compiler.  For
example, if a cross-compiler was configured with <B>configure
arm-elf</B>, meaning to compile for an arm processor with elf binaries,
then you would specify <B>-b arm-elf</B> to run that cross compiler.
Because there are other options beginning with <B>-b</B>, the
configuration must contain a hyphen.
<DT><B>-V</B> <I>version</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBFY"></A>
The argument <I>version</I> specifies which version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to run.
This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
<I>version</I> might be <B>4.0</B>, meaning to run <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> version 4.0.
</DL>
<P>

The <B>-V</B> and <B>-b</B> options work by running the
<I>&lt;machine&gt;-gcc-&lt;version&gt;</I> executable, so there's no real reason to

<H2>Hardware Models and Configurations</H2>

<A NAME="ixBFZ"></A>
Earlier we discussed the standard option <B>-b</B> which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target
machines, such as <FONT SIZE="-1">VAX</FONT> vs. 68000 vs. 80386.
<P>

In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with <B>-m</B>, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations---for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.
<P>

Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.
<P>

<I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>ARM</I></FONT><I> Options</I>
<A NAME="ixBGA"></A>
<P>

These <B>-m</B> options are defined for Advanced <FONT SIZE="-1">RISC</FONT> Machines (<FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT>)
architectures:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-mabi=</B><I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGB"></A>
Generate code for the specified <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>.  Permissible values are: <B>apcs-gnu</B>,
<B>atpcs</B>, <B>aapcs</B>, <B>aapcs-linux</B> and <B>iwmmxt</B>.
<DT><B>-mapcs-frame</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGC"></A>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying <B>-fomit-frame-pointer</B>
with this option will cause the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is <B>-mno-apcs-frame</B>.
<DT><B>-mapcs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGD"></A>
This is a synonym for <B>-mapcs-frame</B>.
<DT><B>-mapcs-stack-check</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGE"></A>
Generate code to check the amount of stack space available upon entry to
every function (that actually uses some stack space).  If there is
insufficient space available then either the function
<B>__rt_stkovf_split_small</B> or <B>__rt_stkovf_split_big</B> will be
called, depending upon the amount of stack space required.  The run time
system is required to provide these functions.  The default is
<B>-mno-apcs-stack-check</B>, since this produces smaller code.
<DT><B>-mapcs-float</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGF"></A>
Pass floating point arguments using the float point registers.  This is
one of the variants of the <FONT SIZE="-1">APCS</FONT>.  This option is recommended if the
target hardware has a floating point unit or if a lot of floating point
arithmetic is going to be performed by the code.  The default is
<B>-mno-apcs-float</B>, since integer only code is slightly increased in
size if <B>-mapcs-float</B> is used.
<DT><B>-mapcs-reentrant</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGG"></A>
Generate reentrant, position independent code.  The default is
<B>-mno-apcs-reentrant</B>.
<DT><B>-mthumb-interwork</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGH"></A>
Generate code which supports calling between the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets cannot
be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
<B>-mno-thumb-interwork</B>, since slightly larger code is generated
when <B>-mthumb-interwork</B> is specified.
<DT><B>-mno-sched-prolog</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGI"></A>
Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions will start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start if functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is <B>-msched-prolog</B>.
<DT><B>-mhard-float</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGJ"></A>
Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default.
<DT><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGK"></A>
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<B>Warning:</B> the requisite libraries are not available for all <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT>
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.


<P>


<B>-msoft-float</B> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <I>all</I> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <I>libgcc.a</I>, the
library that comes with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>, with <B>-msoft-float</B> in order for
this to work.
<DT><B>-mfloat-abi=</B><I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGL"></A>
Specifies which <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> to use for floating point values.  Permissible values
are: <B>soft</B>, <B>softfp</B> and <B>hard</B>.


<P>


<B>soft</B> and <B>hard</B> are equivalent to <B>-msoft-float</B>
and <B>-mhard-float</B> respectively.  <B>softfp</B> allows the generation
of floating point instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling
conventions.
<DT><B>-mlittle-endian</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGM"></A>
Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.
<DT><B>-mbig-endian</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGN"></A>
Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.
<DT><B>-mwords-little-endian</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGO"></A>
This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors.
Generate code for a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte
order.  That is, a byte order of the form <B>32107654</B>.  Note: this
option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for
big-endian <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
2.8.
<DT><B>-mcpu=</B><I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGP"></A>
This specifies the name of the target <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> processor.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses this name
to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  Permissible names are: <B>arm2</B>, <B>arm250</B>,
<B>arm3</B>, <B>arm6</B>, <B>arm60</B>, <B>arm600</B>, <B>arm610</B>,
<B>arm620</B>, <B>arm7</B>, <B>arm7m</B>, <B>arm7d</B>, <B>arm7dm</B>,
<B>arm7di</B>, <B>arm7dmi</B>, <B>arm70</B>, <B>arm700</B>,
<B>arm700i</B>, <B>arm710</B>, <B>arm710c</B>, <B>arm7100</B>,
<B>arm7500</B>, <B>arm7500fe</B>, <B>arm7tdmi</B>, <B>arm7tdmi-s</B>,
<B>arm8</B>, <B>strongarm</B>, <B>strongarm110</B>, <B>strongarm1100</B>,
<B>arm8</B>, <B>arm810</B>, <B>arm9</B>, <B>arm9e</B>, <B>arm920</B>,
<B>arm920t</B>, <B>arm922t</B>, <B>arm946e-s</B>, <B>arm966e-s</B>,
<B>arm968e-s</B>, <B>arm926ej-s</B>, <B>arm940t</B>, <B>arm9tdmi</B>,
<B>arm10tdmi</B>, <B>arm1020t</B>, <B>arm1026ej-s</B>,
<B>arm10e</B>, <B>arm1020e</B>, <B>arm1022e</B>,
<B>arm1136j-s</B>, <B>arm1136jf-s</B>, <B>mpcore</B>, <B>mpcorenovfp</B>,
<B>arm1176jz-s</B>, <B>arm1176jzf-s</B>, <B>xscale</B>, <B>iwmmxt</B>,
<B>ep9312</B>.
<DT><B>-mtune=</B><I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGQ"></A>
This option is very similar to the <B>-mcpu=</B> option, except that
instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> should
tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type
specified in this option, but still choosing the instructions that it
will generate based on the cpu specified by a <B>-mcpu=</B> option.
For some <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> implementations better performance can be obtained by using
this option.
<DT><B>-march=</B><I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGR"></A>
This specifies the name of the target <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> architecture.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the <B>-mcpu=</B> option.  Permissible names are: <B>armv2</B>,
<B>armv2a</B>, <B>armv3</B>, <B>armv3m</B>, <B>armv4</B>, <B>armv4t</B>,
<B>armv5</B>, <B>armv5t</B>, <B>armv5te</B>, <B>armv6</B>, <B>armv6j</B>,
<B>iwmmxt</B>, <B>ep9312</B>.
<DT><B>-mfpu=</B><I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGS"></A>

<DT><B>-mfpe=</B><I>number</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGT"></A>
<DT><B>-mfp=</B><I>number</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGU"></A>

This specifies what floating point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: <B>fpa</B>, <B>fpe2</B>,
<B>fpe3</B>, <B>maverick</B>, <B>vfp</B>.  <B>-mfp</B> and <B>-mfpe</B>
are synonyms for <B>-mfpu</B>=<B>fpe</B><I>number</I>, for compatibility
with older versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.


<P>


If <B>-msoft-float</B> is specified this specifies the format of
floating point values.
<DT><B>-mstructure-size-boundary=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGV"></A>
The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the <FONT SIZE="-1">COFF</FONT>
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> supports it.


<P>


Specifying the larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.
<DT><B>-mabort-on-noreturn</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGW"></A>
Generate a call to the function <TT>&quot;abort&quot;</TT> at the end of a
<TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT> function.  It will be executed if the function tries to
return.
<DT><B>-mlong-calls</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGX"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-long-calls</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGY"></A>

Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing range of the offset based
version of subroutine call instruction.


<P>


Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
which have the <B>short-call</B> attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a <B>#pragma no_long_calls</B> directive and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit, will not be turned into long calls.  The exception to this rule is
that weak function definitions, functions with the <B>long-call</B>
attribute or the <B>section</B> attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a <B>#pragma long_calls</B> directive, will always be
turned into long calls.


<P>


This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
<B>-mno-long-calls</B> will restore the default behavior, as will
placing the function calls within the scope of a <B>#pragma
long_calls_off</B> directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.
<DT><B>-mnop-fun-dllimport</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBGZ"></A>
Disable support for the <TT>&quot;dllimport&quot;</TT> attribute.
<DT><B>-msingle-pic-base</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHA"></A>
Treat the register used for <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The run-time system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.
<DT><B>-mpic-register=</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHB"></A>
Specify the register to be used for <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> addressing.  The default is R10
unless stack-checking is enabled, when R9 is used.
<DT><B>-mcirrus-fix-invalid-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHC"></A>
Insert NOPs into the instruction stream to in order to work around
problems with invalid Maverick instruction combinations.  This option
is only valid if the <B>-mcpu=ep9312</B> option has been used to
enable generation of instructions for the Cirrus Maverick floating
point co-processor.  This option is not enabled by default, since the
problem is only present in older Maverick implementations.  The default
can be re-enabled by use of the <B>-mno-cirrus-fix-invalid-insns</B>
switch.
<DT><B>-mpoke-function-name</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHD"></A>
Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:


<P>




<PRE>
             t0
                 .ascii &quot;arm_poke_function_name&quot;, 0
                 .align
             t1
                 .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
             arm_poke_function_name
                 mov     ip, sp
                 stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                 sub     fp, ip, #4

</PRE>




<P>


When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
<TT>&quot;pc&quot;</TT> stored at <TT>&quot;fp + 0&quot;</TT>.  If the trace function then looks at
location <TT>&quot;pc - 12&quot;</TT> and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length <TT>&quot;((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-mthumb</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHE"></A>
Generate code for the 16-bit Thumb instruction set.  For ARMv7, the default
is to use the <FONT SIZE="-1">THUMB2</FONT> instruction set. For all other architectures, the default
is to use the 32-bit <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> instruction set. The <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> instruction set may be
explicitly selected via <B>-mno-thumb</B> or <B>-marm</B>.
<DT><B>-mtpcs-frame</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHF"></A>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is <B>-mno-tpcs-frame</B>.
<DT><B>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHG"></A>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is <B>-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</B>.
<DT><B>-mcallee-super-interworking</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHH"></A>
Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT>
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.
<DT><B>-mcaller-super-interworking</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHI"></A>
Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.
<DT><B>-mtp=</B><I>name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHJ"></A>
Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The valid
models are <B>soft</B>, which generates calls to <TT>&quot;__aeabi_read_tp&quot;</TT>,
<B>cp15</B>, which fetches the thread pointer from <TT>&quot;cp15&quot;</TT> directly
(supported in the arm6k architecture), and <B>auto</B>, which uses the
best available method for the selected processor.  The default setting is
<B>auto</B>.
<DT><B>-mms-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHK"></A>
Set the default structure layout to be compatible with the Microsoft
compiler standard. This is equivalent to adding an <TT>&quot;ms_struct&quot;</TT>
attribute to each structure and union tag definition. The default is
<B>mno-ms-bitfields</B>.
</DL>
<P>

<I>Darwin Options</I>
<A NAME="ixBHL"></A>
<P>

These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">FSF</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> on Darwin does not create ``universal'' object files; it will create
an object file for the single architecture that it was built to
target.  Apple's <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> on Darwin does create ``universal'' files if multiple
<B>-arch</B> options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
<I>lipo</I>.
<P>

The subtype of the file created (like <B>ppc7400</B> or <B>ppc970</B> or
<B>i686</B>) is determined by the flags that specify the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT>
that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is targetting, like <B>-mcpu</B> or <B>-march</B>.  The
<B>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</B> option can be used to override this.
<P>

The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT>
mismatch.  The assembler, <I>as</I>, will only permit instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64-bit instructions in an <B>ppc750</B> object file.
The linker for shared libraries, <I>/usr/bin/libtool</I>, will fail
and print an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a <B>ppc970</B> object file in a <B>ppc7400</B> library).  The linker
for executables, <I>ld</I>, will quietly give the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-F</B><I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHM"></A>
Add the framework directory <I>dir</I> to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by <B>-I</B> options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.


<P>


A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a <B>``Headers''</B> and/or
<B>``PrivateHeaders''</B> directory contained directly in it that ends
in <B>``.framework''</B>.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the <B>``.framework''</B>.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
<B>``Headers''</B> being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's <B>``Frameworks''</B> directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework, a warning will be issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks, in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in <B>``/System/Library/Frameworks''</B> and
<B>``/Library/Frameworks''</B>.  An example include looks like
<TT>&quot;#include &lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/Framework/header.h">Framework/header.h</A>&gt;&quot;</TT>, where <B>Framework</B> denotes
the name of the framework and header.h is found in the
<B>``PrivateHeaders''</B> or <B>``Headers''</B> directory.
<DT><B>-iframework</B><I>dir</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHN"></A>
Like <B>-F</B> except the directory is a treated as a system
directory.  The main effect is to not warn about constructs contained
within header files found via <I>dir</I>.
<DT><B>-gused</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHO"></A>
Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For <FONT SIZE="-1">STABS</FONT>
debugging format, this enables <B>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</B>.
This is by default <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>.
<DT><B>-gfull</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHP"></A>
Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.
<DT><B>-mmacosx-version-min=</B><I>version</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHQ"></A>
The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on
is <I>version</I>.  Typical values of <I>version</I> include <TT>10.1</TT>,
<TT>10.2</TT>, and <TT>10.3.9</TT>.


<P>


This value can also be set with the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</B></FONT><B></B>
environment variable.  If both the command-line option is specified
and the environment variable is set, the command-line option will
take precedence.


<P>


If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
then the default for this option is the system version on which the
compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices which
are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.


<P>


This value is not set by default for <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> targets.
<DT><B>-miphoneos-version-min=</B><I>version</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHR"></A>
The earliest version of iPhone <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> that this executable will run on
is <I>version</I>.


<P>


This value can also be set with the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</B></FONT><B></B>
environment variable.  If both the command-line option is specified
and the environment variable is set, the command-line option will
take precedence.


<P>


On <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> targets, if not specified by the command-line option or
environment variable, this value defaults to 2.0.
<DT><B>-mkernel</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHS"></A>
Enable kernel development mode.  The <B>-mkernel</B> option sets
<B>-static</B>, <B>-fno-common</B>, <B>-fno-builtin</B>, <B>-fno-cxa-atexit</B>,
<B>-fno-exceptions</B>, <B>-fno-non-call-exceptions</B>, <B>-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables</B>,
<B>-fapple-kext</B>, <B>-fno-weak</B> and <B>-fno-rtti</B> where
applicable.  This mode also sets <B>-mno-altivec</B>,
<B>-msoft-float</B> and <B>-mlong-branch</B> for PowerPC targets,
<B>-mno-red-zone</B> on x86_64, and <B>-mlong-branch</B> for <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT>
targets.  Of these, only -msoft-float can be changed which is useful in
a kext that wishes to use the hardware floating point unit.
<B>-dynamic</B> can be used to override the effects of -static on
the assembler to enable the use of weak_import.
<DT><B>-mone-byte-bool</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHT"></A>
Override the defaults for <B>bool</B> so that <B>sizeof(bool)==1</B>.
By default <B>sizeof(bool)</B> is <B>4</B> when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and <B>1</B> when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
option has no effect on x86.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> The <B>-mone-byte-bool</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all
other modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this
switch to conform to a non-default data model.
<DT><B>-mfix-and-continue</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHU"></A>

<DT><B>-ffix-and-continue</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHV"></A>
<DT><B>-findirect-data</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHW"></A>

Generate code suitable for fast turn around development.  Needed to
enable gdb to dynamically load <TT>&quot;.o&quot;</TT> files into already running
programs.  <B>-findirect-data</B> and <B>-ffix-and-continue</B>
are provided for backwards compatibility.
<DT><B>-fapple-kext</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHX"></A>

<DT><B>-findirect-virtual-calls</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHY"></A>
<DT><B>-fterminated-vtables</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBHZ"></A>

Alter vtables, destructors, and other implementation details to more
closely resemble the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> 2.95 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> for PowerPC and 32-bit i386.  This
is to make kernel extensions loadable by Darwin kernels, and is
required to build any Darwin kernel extension.  In addition, virtual
calls are not made directly, instead, code is generated to always go

<P>

<I>Intel 386 and </I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>AMD</I></FONT><I> x86-64 Options</I>
<A NAME="ixBKP"></A>
<P>

These <B>-m</B> options are defined for the i386 and x86-64 family of
computers:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-mtune=</B><I>cpu-type</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBKQ"></A>
Tune to <I>cpu-type</I> everything applicable about the generated code, except
for the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> and the set of available instructions.  The choices for
<I>cpu-type</I> are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>generic</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBKR"></A>
Produce code optimized for the most common <FONT SIZE="-1">IA32/AMD64/EM64T</FONT> processors.
If you know the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> on which your code will run, then you should use
the corresponding <B>-mtune</B> option instead of
<B>-mtune=generic</B>.  But, if you do not know exactly what <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> users
of your application will have, then you should use this option.


<P>


As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this
option will change.  Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>, the code generated option will change to reflect the processors
that were most common when that version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was released.


<P>


There is no <B>-march=generic</B> option because <B>-march</B>
indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no
generic instruction set applicable to all processors.  In contrast,
<B>-mtune</B> indicates the processor (or, in this case, collection of
processors) for which the code is optimized.
<DT><I>native</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBKS"></A>
This selects the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> to tune for at compilation time by determining
the processor type of the compiling machine.  Using <B>-mtune=native</B>
will produce code optimized for the local machine under the constraints
of the selected instruction set.  Using <B>-march=native</B> will
enable all instruction subsets supported by the local machine (hence
the result might not run on different machines).
<DT><I>i386</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBKT"></A>
Original Intel's i386 <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>.
<DT><I>i486</I><DD>

<A NAME="ixBKY"></A>
Same as <TT>&quot;generic&quot;</TT>, but when used as <TT>&quot;march&quot;</TT> option, PentiumPro

support.
<DT><I>athlon-4, athlon-xp, athlon-mp</I><DD>

<DT><I>c3-2</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLO"></A>

</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


While picking a specific <I>cpu-type</I> will schedule things appropriately
for that particular chip, the compiler will not generate any code that
does not run on the i386 without the <B>-march=</B><I>cpu-type</I> option
being used.
</DL>

<DT><B>-march=</B><I>cpu-type</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLP"></A>
Generate instructions for the machine type <I>cpu-type</I>.  The choices
for <I>cpu-type</I> are the same as for <B>-mtune</B>.  Moreover,
specifying <B>-march=</B><I>cpu-type</I> implies <B>-mtune=</B><I>cpu-type</I>.
<DT><B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu-type</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLQ"></A>
A deprecated synonym for <B>-mtune</B>.
<DT><B>-m386</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLR"></A>

<DT><B>-m486</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLS"></A>
<DT><B>-mpentium</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLT"></A>
<DT><B>-mpentiumpro</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLU"></A>

These options are synonyms for <B>-mtune=i386</B>, <B>-mtune=i486</B>,
<B>-mtune=pentium</B>, and <B>-mtune=pentiumpro</B> respectively.
These synonyms are deprecated.
<DT><B>-mfpmath=</B><I>unit</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLV"></A>
Generate floating point arithmetics for selected unit <I>unit</I>.  The choices
for <I>unit</I> are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>387</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLW"></A>
Use the standard 387 floating point coprocessor present majority of chips and
emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with this option will run almost everywhere.
The temporary results are computed in 80bit precision instead of precision
specified by the type resulting in slightly different results compared to most
of other chips.  See <B>-ffloat-store</B> for more detailed description.


<P>


This is the default choice for i386 compiler.
<DT><B>sse</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLX"></A>
Use scalar floating point instructions present in the <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> instruction set.
This instruction set is supported by Pentium3 and newer chips, in the <FONT SIZE="-1">AMD</FONT> line
by Athlon-4, Athlon-xp and Athlon-mp chips.  The earlier version of <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT>
instruction set supports only single precision arithmetics, thus the double and
extended precision arithmetics is still done using 387.  Later version, present
only in Pentium4 and the future <FONT SIZE="-1">AMD</FONT> x86-64 chips supports double precision
arithmetics too.


<P>


For the i386 compiler, you need to use <B>-march=</B><I>cpu-type</I>, <B>-msse</B>
or <B>-msse2</B> switches to enable <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> extensions and make this option
effective.  For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default.


<P>


The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid
the numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing
code that expects temporaries to be 80bit.


<P>


This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler.
<DT><B>sse,387</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLY"></A>
Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This effectively double the
amount of available registers and on chips with separate execution units for
387 and <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> the execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
still experimental, because the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> register allocator does not model separate
functional units well resulting in instable performance.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
</DL>

<DT><B>-masm=</B><I>dialect</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBLZ"></A>
Output asm instructions using selected <I>dialect</I>.  Supported
choices are <B>intel</B> or <B>att</B> (the default one).  Darwin does
not support <B>intel</B>.
<DT><B>-mieee-fp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMA"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-ieee-fp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMB"></A>

Control whether or not the compiler uses <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> floating point
comparisons.  These handle correctly the case where the result of a
comparison is unordered.
<DT><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMC"></A>
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<B>Warning:</B> the requisite libraries are not part of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.


<P>


On machines where a function returns floating point results in the 80387
register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted even if
<B>-msoft-float</B> is used.
<DT><B>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMD"></A>
Do not use the <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> registers for return values of functions.


<P>


The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
<TT>&quot;float&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> in an <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> register, even if there
is no <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT>.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT>.


<P>


The option <B>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</B> causes such values to be returned
in ordinary <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> registers instead.
<DT><B>-mno-fancy-math-387</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBME"></A>
Some 387 emulators do not support the <TT>&quot;sin&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;cos&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;sqrt&quot;</TT> instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when <B>-march</B>
indicates that the target cpu will always have an <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> and so the
instruction will not need emulation.  As of revision 2.6.1, these
instructions are not generated unless you also use the
<B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> switch.
<DT><B>-malign-double</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMF"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-align-double</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMG"></A>

Control whether <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> aligns <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>, and
<TT>&quot;long long&quot;</TT> variables on a two word boundary or a one word
boundary.  Aligning <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> variables on a two word boundary will
produce code that runs somewhat faster on a <B>Pentium</B> at the
expense of more memory.


<P>


On x86-64, <B>-malign-double</B> is enabled by default.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you use the <B>-malign-double</B> switch,
structures containing the above types will be aligned differently than
the published application binary interface specifications for the 386
and will not be binary compatible with structures in code compiled
without that switch.
<DT><B>-m96bit-long-double</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMH"></A>

<DT><B>-m128bit-long-double</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMI"></A>

These switches control the size of <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> type.  The i386
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits,
so <B>-m96bit-long-double</B> is the default in 32 bit mode.


<P>


Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>
to be aligned to an 8 or 16 byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
conforming to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>, this would not be possible.  So specifying a
<B>-m128bit-long-double</B> will align <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>
to a 16 byte boundary by padding the <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> with an additional
32 bit zero.


<P>


In the x86-64 compiler, <B>-m128bit-long-double</B> is the default choice as
its <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> specifies that <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> is to be aligned on 16 byte boundary.


<P>


Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87
standard of 80 bits for a <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you override the default value for your target <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>, the
structures and arrays containing <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> variables will change
their size as well as function calling convention for function taking
<TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> will be modified.  Hence they will not be binary
compatible with arrays or structures in code compiled without that switch.
<DT><B>-mmlarge-data-threshold=</B><I>number</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMJ"></A>
When <B>-mcmodel=medium</B> is specified, the data greater than
<I>threshold</I> are placed in large data section.  This value must be the
same across all object linked into the binary and defaults to 65535.
<DT><B>-msvr3-shlib</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMK"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-svr3-shlib</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBML"></A>

Control whether <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> places uninitialized local variables into the
<TT>&quot;bss&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;data&quot;</TT> segments.  <B>-msvr3-shlib</B> places them
into <TT>&quot;bss&quot;</TT>.  These options are meaningful only on System V Release 3.
<DT><B>-mrtd</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMM"></A>
Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the <TT>&quot;ret&quot;</TT> <I>num</I>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.


<P>


You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute <B>stdcall</B>.  You can also
override the <B>-mrtd</B> option by using the function attribute
<B>cdecl</B>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.


<P>


Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.


<P>


In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)
<DT><B>-mregparm=</B><I>num</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMN"></A>
Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute <B>regparm</B>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you use this switch, and
<I>num</I> is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and
startup modules.
<DT><B>-msseregparm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMO"></A>
Use <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> register passing conventions for float and double arguments
and return values.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute <B>sseregparm</B>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you use this switch then you must build all
modules with the same value, including any libraries.  This includes
the system libraries and startup modules.
<DT><B>-mstackrealign</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMP"></A>
Realign the stack at entry.  On the Intel x86, the
<B>-mstackrealign</B> option will generate an alternate prologue and
epilogue that realigns the runtime stack.  This supports mixing legacy
codes that keep a 4-byte aligned stack with modern codes that keep a
16-byte stack for <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> compatibility.  The alternate prologue and
epilogue are slower and bigger than the regular ones, and the
alternate prologue requires an extra scratch register; this lowers the
number of registers available if used in conjunction with the
<TT>&quot;regparm&quot;</TT> attribute.  The <B>-mstackrealign</B> option is
incompatible with the nested function prologue; this is considered a
hard error.  See also the attribute <TT>&quot;force_align_arg_pointer&quot;</TT>,
applicable to individual functions.
<DT><B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</B><I>num</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBMQ"></A>
Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <I>num</I>
byte boundary.  If <B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</B> is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).


<P>


On Pentium and PentiumPro, <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> values
should be aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see <B>-malign-double</B>) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium <FONT SIZE="-1">III</FONT>, the
Streaming <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> Extension (<FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT>) data type <TT>&quot;__m128&quot;</TT> may not work
properly if it is not 16 byte aligned.


<P>


To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary will most likely misalign the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.


<P>


This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to <B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</B>.

These switches enable or disable the use of instructions in the <FONT SIZE="-1">MMX</FONT>,

also available as built-in functions: see <B>X86 Built-in Functions</B>,
for details of the functions enabled and disabled by these switches.


<P>


To have <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE/SSE2</FONT> instructions generated automatically from floating-point
code (as opposed to 387 instructions), see <B>-mfpmath=sse</B>.


<P>


These options will enable <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use these extended instructions in
generated code, even without <B>-mfpmath=sse</B>.  Applications which
perform runtime <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> detection must compile separate files for each
supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In particular,
the file containing the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> detection code should be compiled without
these options.
<DT><B>-mpush-args</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNL"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-push-args</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNM"></A>

Use <FONT SIZE="-1">PUSH</FONT> operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter
and usually equally fast as method using <FONT SIZE="-1">SUB/MOV</FONT> operations and is enabled
by default.  In some cases disabling it may improve performance because of
improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.
<DT><B>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNN"></A>
If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments will be
computed in the function prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs
because of reduced dependencies, improved scheduling and reduced stack usage
when preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a notable
increase in code size.  This switch implies <B>-mno-push-args</B>.
<DT><B>-mthreads</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNO"></A>
Support thread-safe exception handling on <B>Mingw32</B>.  Code that relies
on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all code with the
<B>-mthreads</B> option.  When compiling, <B>-mthreads</B> defines
<B>-D_MT</B>; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library
<B>-lmingwthrd</B> which cleans up per thread exception handling data.
<DT><B>-mno-align-stringops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNP"></A>
Do not align destination of inlined string operations.  This switch reduces
code size and improves performance in case the destination is already aligned,
but <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> doesn't know about it.
<DT><B>-minline-all-stringops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNQ"></A>
By default <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> inlines string operations only when destination is known to be
aligned at least to 4 byte boundary.  This enables more inlining, increase code
size, but may improve performance of code that depends on fast memcpy, strlen
and memset for short lengths.
<DT><B>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNR"></A>
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This
avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.  The option
<B>-fomit-frame-pointer</B> removes the frame pointer for all functions
which might make debugging harder.
<DT><B>-mtls-direct-seg-refs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNS"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNT"></A>

Controls whether <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> variables may be accessed with offsets from the
<FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> segment register (<TT>%gs</TT> for 32-bit, <TT>%fs</TT> for 64-bit),
or whether the thread base pointer must be added.  Whether or not this
is legal depends on the operating system, and whether it maps the
segment to cover the entire <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> area.


<P>


For systems that use <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> libc, the default is on.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-m32</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNU"></A>

<DT><B>-m64</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNV"></A>

Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.
The 32-bit environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and
generates code that runs on any i386 system.
The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer
to 64 bits and generates code for <FONT SIZE="-1">AMD</FONT>'s x86-64 architecture. For
darwin only the -m64 option turns off the <B>-fno-pic</B> and
<B>-mdynamic-no-pic</B> options.
<DT><B>-mno-red-zone</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNW"></A>
Do not use a so called red zone for x86-64 code.  The red zone is mandated
by the x86-64 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>, it is a 128-byte area beyond the location of the
stack pointer that will not be modified by signal or interrupt handlers
and therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack
pointer.  The flag <B>-mno-red-zone</B> disables this red zone.
<DT><B>-mcmodel=small</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNX"></A>
Generate code for the small code model: the program and its symbols must
be linked in the lower 2 <FONT SIZE="-1">GB</FONT> of the address space.  Pointers are 64 bits.
Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.  This is the default
code model.
<DT><B>-mcmodel=kernel</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNY"></A>
Generate code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in the
negative 2 <FONT SIZE="-1">GB</FONT> of the address space.
This model has to be used for Linux kernel code.
<DT><B>-mcmodel=medium</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBNZ"></A>
Generate code for the medium model: The program is linked in the lower 2
<FONT SIZE="-1">GB</FONT> of the address space but symbols can be located anywhere in the
address space.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked, but
building of shared libraries are not supported with the medium model.
<DT><B>-mcmodel=large</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBOA"></A>

this model.
<DT><B>-mms-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBOB"></A>

<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports two related instruction set architectures for the
<FONT SIZE="-1">RS/6000</FONT> and PowerPC.  The <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>POWER</I></FONT><I></I> instruction set are those
instructions supported by the <B>rios</B> chip set used in the original
<FONT SIZE="-1">RS/6000</FONT> systems and the <I>PowerPC</I> instruction set is the
architecture of the Freescale MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and
the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT> 4xx, 6xx, and follow-on microprocessors.


<P>


Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An <FONT SIZE="-1">MQ</FONT>
register is included in processors supporting the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER</FONT> architecture.


<P>


You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.  Specifying the
<B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I> overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the <B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I> option
rather than the options listed above.


<P>


The <B>-mpower</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate instructions that
are found only in the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER</FONT> architecture and to use the <FONT SIZE="-1">MQ</FONT> register.
Specifying <B>-mpower2</B> implies <B>-power</B> and also allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
to generate instructions that are present in the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER2</FONT> architecture but
not the original <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER</FONT> architecture.


<P>


The <B>-mpowerpc</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate instructions that
are found only in the 32-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture.
Specifying <B>-mpowerpc-gpopt</B> implies <B>-mpowerpc</B> and also allows
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
<B>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</B> implies <B>-mpowerpc</B> and also allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.


<P>


The <B>-mmfcrf</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the move from
condition register field instruction implemented on the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER4</FONT>
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01
architecture.
The <B>-mpopcntb</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the popcount and
double precision <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> reciprocal estimate instruction implemented on the
<FONT SIZE="-1">POWER5</FONT> processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture.
The <B>-mfprnd</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> round to
integer instructions implemented on the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER5+</FONT> processor and other
processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.


<P>


The <B>-mpowerpc64</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the additional
64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64 architecture
and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults to
<B>-mno-powerpc64</B>.


<P>


If you specify both <B>-mno-power</B> and <B>-mno-powerpc</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures plus some special <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> common-mode calls, and will not use
the <FONT SIZE="-1">MQ</FONT> register.  Specifying both <B>-mpower</B> and <B>-mpowerpc</B>
permits <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use any instruction from either architecture and to
allow use of the <FONT SIZE="-1">MQ</FONT> register; specify this for the Motorola <FONT SIZE="-1">MPC601</FONT>.
<DT><B>-mnew-mnemonics</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBOW"></A>

<DT><B>-mold-mnemonics</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBOX"></A>

Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code.  With
<B>-mnew-mnemonics</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses the assembler mnemonics defined for
the PowerPC architecture.  With <B>-mold-mnemonics</B> it uses the
assembler mnemonics defined for the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER</FONT> architecture.  Instructions
defined in only one architecture have only one mnemonic; <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses that
mnemonic irrespective of which of these options is specified.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the architecture in
use.  Specifying <B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I> sometimes overrides the
value of these option.  Unless you are building a cross-compiler, you
should normally not specify either <B>-mnew-mnemonics</B> or
<B>-mold-mnemonics</B>, but should instead accept the default.
<DT><B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBOY"></A>

<B>rios</B>, <B>rios1</B>, <B>rios2</B>, <B>rsc</B>, and <B>rs64</B>.


<P>


<B>-mcpu=common</B> selects a completely generic processor.  Code
generated under this option will run on any <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER</FONT> or PowerPC processor.
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures, and will not use the <FONT SIZE="-1">MQ</FONT> register.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> assumes a generic
processor model for scheduling purposes.


<P>


<B>-mcpu=power</B>, <B>-mcpu=power2</B>, <B>-mcpu=powerpc</B>, and
<B>-mcpu=powerpc64</B> specify generic <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER2</FONT>, pure 32-bit
PowerPC (i.e., not <FONT SIZE="-1">MPC601</FONT>), and 64-bit PowerPC architecture machine
types, with an appropriate, generic processor model assumed for
scheduling purposes.


<P>


The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated under
those options will run best on that processor, and may not run at all on
others.


<P>


The <B>-mcpu</B> options automatically enable or disable the
following options: <B>-maltivec</B>, <B>-mfprnd</B>,
<B>-mhard-float</B>, <B>-mmfcrf</B>, <B>-mmultiple</B>,
<B>-mnew-mnemonics</B>, <B>-mpopcntb</B>, <B>-mpower</B>,
<B>-mpower2</B>, <B>-mpowerpc64</B>, <B>-mpowerpc-gpopt</B>,
<B>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</B>, <B>-mstring</B>, <B>-mmulhw</B>, <B>-mdlmzb</B>.
The particular options
set for any particular <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> will vary between compiler versions,
depending on what setting seems to produce optimal code for that <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>;
it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual hardware's capabilities.  If
you wish to set an individual option to a particular value, you may
specify it after the <B>-mcpu</B> option, like <B>-mcpu=970
-mno-altivec</B>.


<P>


On <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT>, the <B>-maltivec</B> and <B>-mpowerpc64</B> options are
not enabled or disabled by the <B>-mcpu</B> option at present because
<FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> does not have full support for these options.  You may still
enable or disable them individually if you're sure it'll work in your
environment.
<DT><B>-mtune=</B><I>cpu_type</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBOZ"></A>
Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
<I>cpu_type</I>, but do not set the architecture type, register usage, or
choice of mnemonics, as <B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I> would.  The same
values for <I>cpu_type</I> are used for <B>-mtune</B> as for
<B>-mcpu</B>.  If both are specified, the code generated will use the
architecture, registers, and mnemonics set by <B>-mcpu</B>, but the
scheduling parameters set by <B>-mtune</B>.
<DT><B>-mswdiv</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBPA"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-swdiv</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBPB"></A>

Generate code to compute division as reciprocal estimate and iterative
refinement, creating opportunities for increased throughput.  This
feature requires: optional PowerPC Graphics instruction set for single
precision and <FONT SIZE="-1">FRE</FONT> instruction for double precision, assuming divides
cannot generate user-visible traps, and the domain values not include
Infinities, denormals or zero denominator.
<DT><B>-maltivec</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBPC"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-altivec</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBPD"></A>

Generate code that uses (does not use) AltiVec instructions, and also
enable the use of built-in functions that allow more direct access to
the AltiVec instruction set.  You may also need to set
<B>-mabi=altivec</B> to adjust the current <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> with AltiVec <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>
enhancements.
<DT><B>-mpim-altivec</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBPE"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-pim-altivec</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBPF"></A>

Enable (or disable) built-in compiler support for the syntactic extensions as
well as operations and predicates defined in the Motorola AltiVec
Technology Programming Interface Manual (<FONT SIZE="-1">PIM</FONT>).  This includes the
recognition of <TT>&quot;vector&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;pixel&quot;</TT> as (context-dependent)
keywords, the definition of built-in functions such as <TT>&quot;vec_add&quot;</TT>,
and the use of parenthesized comma expression as AltiVec literals.
Note that unlike the option <B>-maltivec</B>, the extension does not require
the inclusion of any special header files; if <TT>&quot;&lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/altivec.h">altivec.h</A>&gt;&quot;</TT> is included,
a warning will be issued and the contents of the header will be
ignored.  The preprocessor shall provide an <TT>&quot;__APPLE_ALTIVEC__&quot;</TT>
manifest constant when <B>-mpim-altivec</B> is specified.  (<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>)


<P>


In addition, the <B>-mpim-altivec</B> option disables the inlining of
functions containing AltiVec instructions into functions that do not make
use of the vector unit.  Certain other optimizations, such as inline 
vectorization of <TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> calls, are also disabled.
These adjustments make it possible to compile programs whose use of AltiVec
instructions is preceded by a run-time check for the presence of AltiVec
functionality, and that can therefore be made to run on G3 processors.
Note that all of these optimizations may be re-enabled by supplying
the <B>-maltivec</B> option, or an <B>-mcpu</B> option specifying
a processor that supports AltiVec instructions.
<DT><B>-mvrsave</B><DD>

<A NAME="ixBPT"></A>

Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin and <FONT SIZE="-1">SVR4</FONT>
targets (including GNU/Linux).  The 32-bit environment sets int, long
and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any PowerPC
variant.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and

<DT><B>-mminimal-toc</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBPX"></A>

Modify generation of the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The <B>-mfull-toc</B> option is selected by
default.  In that case, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will allocate at least one <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
will also place floating-point constants in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT>.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT>.


<P>


If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> space, you can reduce the amount of <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> space used
with the <B>-mno-fp-in-toc</B> and <B>-mno-sum-in-toc</B> options.
<B>-mno-fp-in-toc</B> prevents <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> from putting floating-point
constants in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> and <B>-mno-sum-in-toc</B> forces <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run-time instead of putting that sum into the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT>.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> space.


<P>


If you still run out of space in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> even when you specify both of
these options, specify <B>-mminimal-toc</B> instead.  This option causes
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to make only one <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will produce code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently executed code.

Produce code that conforms more closely to <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">XL</FONT> compiler semantics
when using AIX-compatible <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>.  Pass floating-point arguments to
prototyped functions beyond the register save area (<FONT SIZE="-1">RSA</FONT>) on the stack
in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume that most significant
double in 128-bit long double value is properly rounded when comparing
values and converting to double.  Use <FONT SIZE="-1">XL</FONT> symbol names for long double
support routines.


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">XL</FONT>
compilers access floating point arguments which do not fit in the
<FONT SIZE="-1">RSA</FONT> from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the
stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
default and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">XL</FONT> compilers without optimization.

<A NAME="ixBQE"></A>

On <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT>, 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the option
<B>-malign-natural</B> overrides the ABI-defined alignment of larger
types, such as floating-point doubles, on their natural size-based boundary.
The option <B>-malign-power</B> instructs <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to follow the ABI-specified
alignment rules.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults to the standard alignment defined in the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>.


<P>


On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and <B>-malign-power</B>

<A NAME="ixBQG"></A>

Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register set.
Software floating point emulation is provided if you use the
<B>-msoft-float</B> option, and pass the option to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> when linking.


<P>


(<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLE</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ONLY</FONT>) While the -msoft-float option is supported, the libraries that
do the floating point emulation are not shipped on Apple PowerPCs, with the
effect that the emulation does not work.  However, the option
may be useful for a different reason.  Normally the compiler can use floating
point registers in contexts where you might not expect it, for example, to
copy data from one memory location to another.  The -msoft-float option will
prevent it from doing this.
<DT><B>-mmultiple</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBQH"></A>

<A NAME="ixBQI"></A>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word

instructions are generated by default on <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER</FONT> systems, and not
generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use <B>-mmultiple</B> on little
endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when the
processor is in little endian mode.  The exceptions are <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC740</FONT> and

Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions
that update the base register to the address of the calculated memory
location.  These instructions are generated by default.  If you use
<B>-mno-update</B>, there is a small window between the time that the

On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items less than or
equal to <I>num</I> bytes into the small data or bss sections instead of
the normal data or bss section.  By default, <I>num</I> is 8.  The
<B>-G</B> <I>num</I> switch is also passed to the linker.
All modules should be compiled with the same <B>-G</B> <I>num</I> value.
<DT><B>-mregnames</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBSS"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-regnames</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBST"></A>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit register
names in the assembly language output using symbolic forms.
<DT><B>-mlongcall</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBSU"></A>

<DT><B>-mno-longcall</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBSV"></A>
<DT><B>-mlong-branch</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBSW"></A>
<DT><B>-mno-long-branch</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBSX"></A>

By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer more
expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for calls
further than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call will be generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the <TT>&quot;shortcall&quot;</TT> function attribute, or by <TT>&quot;#pragma
longcall(0)&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> linker can do this,
as can the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.


<P>


On Darwin/PPC systems, <TT>&quot;#pragma longcall&quot;</TT> will generate ``jbsr
callee, L42'', plus a ``branch island'' (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the ``branch island''.  The
Darwin/PPC linker will prefer the first address and generate a ``bl
callee'' if the <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC</FONT> ``bl'' instruction will reach the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker will generate ``bl L42'' to call the ``branch
island''.  The ``branch island'' is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.


<P>


On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, <B>-mlongcall</B> directs the compiler
emit to the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides
whether to use or discard it.  <B>-mlong-branch</B> is a synonym for
<B>-mlongcall</B>.


<P>


In the future, we may cause <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to ignore all longcall specifications
when the linker is known to generate glue.
<DT><B>-pthread</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBSY"></A>
Adds support for multithreading with the <I>pthreads</I> library.
This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker.
<DT><B>-mms-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBSZ"></A>
Set the default structure layout to be compatible with the Microsoft
compiler standard. This is equivalent to adding an <TT>&quot;ms_struct&quot;</TT>
attribute to each structure and union tag definition. The default is
<B>mno-ms-bitfields</B>.

<H2>Options for Code Generation Conventions</H2>

<A NAME="ixBTA"></A>
These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.
<P>

Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <B>-ffoo</B> would be <B>-fno-foo</B>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed---the one which is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <B>no-</B> or adding
it.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fbounds-check</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTB"></A>
For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran front-ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.
<DT><B>-fwrapv</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTC"></A>
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front-end, as required by the Java language specification.
<DT><B>-fexceptions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTD"></A>
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will generate frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will enable it by default for languages like
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> which normally require exception handling, and disable it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs that don't
use exception handling.
<DT><B>-fnon-call-exceptions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTE"></A>
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <I>trapping</I>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating
point instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as <TT>&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-funwind-tables</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTF"></A>
Similar to <B>-fexceptions</B>, except that it will just generate any needed
static data, but will not affect the generated code in any other way.
You will normally not enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling would enable it on your behalf.
<DT><B>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTG"></A>
Generate unwind table in dwarf2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
<DT><B>-fpcc-struct-return</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTH"></A>
Return ``short'' <TT>&quot;struct&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;union&quot;</TT> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).


<P>


The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.


<P>


Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> code compiled with the <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<B>-freg-struct-return</B> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-freg-struct-return</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTI"></A>
Return <TT>&quot;struct&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;union&quot;</TT> values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
<B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>.


<P>


If you specify neither <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B> nor
<B>-freg-struct-return</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
defaults to <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>, except on targets where <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> code compiled with the <B>-freg-struct-return</B>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<B>-fpcc-struct-return</B> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-fshort-enums</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTJ"></A>
Allocate to an <TT>&quot;enum&quot;</TT> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <TT>&quot;enum&quot;</TT> type
will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fshort-enums</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-fshort-double</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTK"></A>
Use the same size for <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> as for <TT>&quot;float&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fshort-double</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-fshort-wchar</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTL"></A>
Override the underlying type for <B>wchar_t</B> to be <B>short
unsigned int</B> instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under <FONT SIZE="-1">WINE</FONT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fshort-wchar</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-fno-common</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTM"></A>
In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the
object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.  This has the
effect that if the same variable is declared (without <TT>&quot;extern&quot;</TT>) in
two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.
The only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems which always work this way.
<DT><B>-fno-ident</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTN"></A>
Ignore the <B>#ident</B> directive.
<DT><B>-finhibit-size-directive</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTO"></A>
Don't output a <TT>&quot;.size&quot;</TT> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <I>crtstuff.c</I>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
<DT><B>-fverbose-asm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTP"></A>
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).


<P>


<B>-fno-verbose-asm</B>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.
<DT><B>-fpic</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTQ"></A>
Generate position-independent code (<FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT>) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (<FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT>).  The dynamic
loader resolves the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>; it is part of the operating system).  If
the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<B>-fpic</B> does not work; in that case, recompile with <B>-fPIC</B>
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT> and 32k
on the m68k and <FONT SIZE="-1">RS/6000</FONT>.  The 386 has no such limit.)


<P>


Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">RS/6000</FONT> is always
position-independent.


<P>


When this flag is set, the macros <TT>&quot;__pic__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__PIC__&quot;</TT>
are defined to 1.
<DT><B>-fPIC</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTR"></A>
If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k,
PowerPC and <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT>.


<P>


Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.


<P>


When this flag is set, the macros <TT>&quot;__pic__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__PIC__&quot;</TT>
are defined to 2.


<P>


<B>-fPIC</B> is the default on Darwin and Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X.
<DT><B>-fpie</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTS"></A>

<DT><B>-fPIE</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTT"></A>

These options are similar to <B>-fpic</B> and <B>-fPIC</B>, but
generated position independent code can be only linked into executables.
Usually these options are used when <B>-pie</B> <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> option will be
used during linking.
<DT><B>-fno-jump-tables</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTU"></A>
Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with <B>-fpic</B> or <B>-fPIC</B> for
building code which forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> and this option is not needed.
<DT><B>-ffixed-</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTV"></A>
Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).


<P>


<I>reg</I> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <TT>&quot;REGISTER_NAMES&quot;</TT>
macro in the machine description macro file.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT><B>-fcall-used-</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTW"></A>
Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
will not save and restore the register <I>reg</I>.


<P>


It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT><B>-fcall-saved-</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTX"></A>
Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as an allocable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
the register <I>reg</I> if they use it.


<P>


It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.


<P>


A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT><B>-fpack-struct[=</B><I>n</I><B>]</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTY"></A>
Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this will be output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fpack-struct</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-finstrument-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBTZ"></A>
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<TT>&quot;__builtin_return_address&quot;</TT> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)


<P>




<PRE>
        void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                       void *call_site);
        void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                       void *call_site);

</PRE>




<P>


The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.


<P>


This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <B>extern inline</B> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)


<P>


A function may be given the attribute <TT>&quot;no_instrument_function&quot;</TT>, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).
<DT><B>-fstack-check</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUA"></A>
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.


<P>


Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system must do that.  The switch causes generation of code
to ensure that the operating system sees the stack being extended.
<DT><B>-fstack-limit-register=</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUB"></A>

<DT><B>-fstack-limit-symbol=</B><I>sym</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUC"></A>
<DT><B>-fno-stack-limit</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUD"></A>

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack
would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.


<P>


For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <B>0x80000000</B>
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
<B>-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit</B> and
<B>-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</B> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker.
<DT><B>-fargument-alias</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUE"></A>

<DT><B>-fargument-noalias</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUF"></A>
<DT><B>-fargument-noalias-global</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUG"></A>
<DT><B>-fargument-noalias-anything</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUH"></A>

Specify the possible relationships among parameters and between
parameters and global data.


<P>


<B>-fargument-alias</B> specifies that arguments (parameters) may
alias each other and may alias global storage.<B>-fargument-noalias</B> specifies that arguments do not alias
each other, but may alias global storage.<B>-fargument-noalias-global</B> specifies that arguments do not
alias each other and do not alias global storage.
<B>-fargument-noalias-anything</B> specifies that arguments do not
alias any other storage.


<P>


Each language will automatically use whatever option is required by
the language standard.  You should not need to use these options yourself.
<DT><B>-fleading-underscore</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUI"></A>
This option and its counterpart, <B>-fno-leading-underscore</B>, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fleading-underscore</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.
<DT><B>-ftls-model=</B><I>model</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUJ"></A>
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The <I>model</I> argument should be one of <TT>&quot;global-dynamic&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;local-dynamic&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;initial-exec&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;local-exec&quot;</TT>.


<P>


The default without <B>-fpic</B> is <TT>&quot;initial-exec&quot;</TT>; with
<B>-fpic</B> the default is <TT>&quot;global-dynamic&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-fvisibility=</B><I>default|internal|hidden|protected</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUK"></A>
Set the default <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> image symbol visibility to the specified option---all
symbols will be marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is <B>strongly</B> recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.


<P>


Despite the nomenclature, <TT>&quot;default&quot;</TT> always means public ie;
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
<TT>&quot;protected&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;internal&quot;</TT> are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option will be <TT>&quot;hidden&quot;</TT>.
The default if <B>-fvisibility</B> isn't specified is
<TT>&quot;default&quot;</TT>, i.e., make every
symbol public---this causes the same behavior as previous versions of
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.


<P>


A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT>
symbols have the correct visibility is given by ``How To Write
Shared Libraries'' by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
&lt;<B><A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/">http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/</A></B>&gt;)---however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with <FONT SIZE="-1">DLL</FONT>'s on Windows and with <B>-fvisibility=hidden</B>
and <TT>&quot;__attribute__ ((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))&quot;</TT> instead of
<TT>&quot;__declspec(dllexport)&quot;</TT> you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.


<P>


For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
<B>#pragma </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC</B></FONT><B> visibility</B> of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
<B>#pragma </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC</B></FONT><B> visibility push(hidden)</B> and
<B>#pragma </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC</B></FONT><B> visibility pop</B>.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed <B>as
part of the </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>API</B></FONT><B> interface contract</B> and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default ie; declarations
only for use within the local <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO</FONT> should <B>always</B> be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> indirection overheads---making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> specification requirements, operator new and
operator delete must always be of default visibility.


<P>


Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say <B>#pragma </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC</B></FONT><B> visibility push(default)</B>
before including any such headers.


<P>


<B>extern</B> declarations are not affected by <B>-fvisibility</B>, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with <B>-fvisibility=hidden</B> with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to <B>extern</B>
functions with no explicit visibility will use the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT>, so it is more
effective to use <B>__attribute ((visibility))</B> and/or
<B>#pragma </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC</B></FONT><B> visibility</B> to tell the compiler which <B>extern</B>
declarations should be treated as hidden.


<P>


Note that <B>-fvisibility</B> does affect C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that will
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the <B>type_info</B> nodes will be unified between
the DSOs.


<P>

is at &lt;<B><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</A></B>&gt;.

Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as

<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_ALL</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUP"></A>

These environment variables control the way that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses
localization information that allow <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to work with different
national conventions.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> inspects the locale categories
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B> and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is <B>en_GB.UTF-8</B> for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.


<P>


The <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable specifies character
classification.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.


<P>


The <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.


<P>


If the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_ALL</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B> and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B>; otherwise, <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B>
and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B> default to the value of the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>TMPDIR</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUQ"></A>
If <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>TMPDIR</B></FONT><B></B> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUR"></A>
If <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.


<P>


If <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> is not set, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.


<P>


If <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.


<P>


The default value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> is
<I>prefix/lib/gcc/</I> where <I>prefix</I> is the value
of <TT>&quot;prefix&quot;</TT> when you ran the <I>configure</I> script.


<P>


Other prefixes specified with <B>-B</B> take precedence over this prefix.


<P>


This prefix is also used for finding files such as <I>crt0.o</I> that are
used for linking.


<P>


In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <B>/usr/local/lib/gcc</B>
(more precisely, with the value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</B></FONT><B></B>), <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <B>-Bfoo/</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will search
<I>foo/bar</I> where it would normally search <I>/usr/local/lib/bar</I>.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>COMPILER_PATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUS"></A>
The value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>COMPILER_PATH</B></FONT><B></B> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LIBRARY_PATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUT"></A>
The value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LIBRARY_PATH</B></FONT><B></B> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B>.  When configured as a native compiler,
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.  Linking
using <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <B>-l</B> option (but directories specified with
<B>-L</B> come first).
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUU"></A>
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B> are recognized:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>C-JIS</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUV"></A>
Recognize <FONT SIZE="-1">JIS</FONT> characters.
<DT><B>C-SJIS</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUW"></A>
Recognize <FONT SIZE="-1">SJIS</FONT> characters.
<DT><B>C-EUCJP</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUX"></A>
Recognize <FONT SIZE="-1">EUCJP</FONT> characters.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


If <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
</DL>

<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUY"></A>

<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBUZ"></A>

These variables are used to set the target <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> version, as described
for command-line options <B>-mmacosx-version-min</B> and
<B>-miphoneos-version-min</B>.  Only one <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> version can be specified
per architecture, with <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</B></FONT><B></B> taking precedence
on non-ARM targets and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</B></FONT><B></B> taking
precedence on <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> targets.


<P>


If either command-line option <B>-mmacosx-version-min</B> or
<B>-miphoneos-version-min</B> is specified, both of these
environment variables are ignored.
</DL>
<P>

Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBVA"></A>

<DT><B>C_INCLUDE_PATH</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBVB"></A>
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBVC"></A>
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBVD"></A>

Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B>, in which to look for header files.
The special character, <TT>&quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;</TT>, is target-dependent and
determined at <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.


<P>


<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPATH</B></FONT><B></B> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <B>-I</B>, but after any paths given with <B>-I</B>
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.


<P>


The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with <B>-isystem</B>, but after any
paths given with <B>-isystem</B> options on the command line.


<P>


In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPATH</B></FONT><B></B> is <TT>&quot;:/special/include&quot;</TT>, that has the same
effect as <B>-I.&nbsp;-I/special/include</B>.
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBVE"></A>
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.


<P>


The value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></FONT><B></B> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<I>file</I><B> </B><I>target</I>, in which case the rules are written to
file <I>file</I> using <I>target</I> as the target name.


<P>


In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options <B>-MM</B> and <B>-MF</B>,
with an optional <B>-MT</B> switch too.
<DT><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</B></FONT><B></B><DD>
<A NAME="ixBVF"></A>
This variable is the same as <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></FONT><B></B> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
<B>-M</B> rather than <B>-MM</B>.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.

On some systems, <B>gcc -shared</B>
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
multi-libbed systems, <B>gcc -shared</B> must select the correct support
libraries to link against.  Failing to supply the correct flags may lead
to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not necessary
is innocuous.
