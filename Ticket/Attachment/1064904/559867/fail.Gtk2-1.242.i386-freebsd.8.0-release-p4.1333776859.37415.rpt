Dear Brian Manning,

This is a computer-generated report for Gtk2-1.242
on perl 5.15.9, created by CPAN-Reporter-1.2005.

Thank you for uploading your work to CPAN.  However, there was a problem
testing your distribution.

If you think this report is invalid, please consult the CPAN Testers Wiki
for suggestions on how to avoid getting FAIL reports for missing library
or binary dependencies, unsupported operating systems, and so on:
