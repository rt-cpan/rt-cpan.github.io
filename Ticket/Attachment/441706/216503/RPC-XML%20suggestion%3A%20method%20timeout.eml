Subject: RPC-XML suggestion: method timeout

I have been using your RPC-XML Perl package for a while, and like it a lot.

Here's a suggestion for additional function with a few lines of code:
In a single-threaded server like this, a hung XML-RPC method can do a
lot of damage.  I use alarm() or Time::HiRes::setitimer() in my method
code to deal with this.  But since it's a common problem for all
methods, it would be convenient to have RPC::XML::Procedure do that
for me.  It would also be nice to have a default method timeout for
the whole server.
