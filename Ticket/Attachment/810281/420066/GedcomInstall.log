Checking if your kit is complete...
Looks good
Writing Makefile for Gedcom

checking for Date::Manip.pm........ /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/Date/Manip.pm
checking for Text::Soundex.pm...... /usr/lib/perl/5.10/Text/Soundex.pm
checking for Parse::RecDescent.pm.. /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/Parse/RecDescent.pm
checking for Roman.pm.............. not found

Roman.pm is required to use the Gedcom function roman().  This function may be
called from lines2perl if your LifeLines program calls roman().  This function
will be unavailable until you install this module, available from CPAN.  In the
meantime, you may continue to use the rest of Gedcom.pm.

checking for working IO::Handle.... working
