 =head1 DESCRIPTION
 
 This module aliases one package name to another. After running the
-SYNOPSIS code,  C<@INC> and C<@Foo::INC> reference the same memory.
-C<$Really::Long::Package::Name::var> and $P::var do as well.
+SYNOPSIS code,  C<@INC> (shorthand for C<@main::INC>) and C<@Foo::INC>
+reference the same memory, likewise for the other pairings.
 
-To be strict-compliant, you'll need to quote any packages on the
-left-hand side of a => if the namespace has colons. Packages on the
-right-hand side all have to be quoted. This is documented as
-L<perlop/"Comma Operator">.
-
-Chip Salzenberg says that it's not technically feasible to perform
-runtime namespace aliasing.  At compile time, Perl grabs pointers to
-functions and global vars.  Those pointers aren't updated if we alias
-the namespace at runtime.
+To facilitate some crafty slight of hand, the above will also
+C<use P> if it's not already loaded, and tell Perl that
+C<Really::Long::Package::Name> is already loaded.
