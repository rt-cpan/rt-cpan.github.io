1. How to Install Term::ReadLine::Gnu

	You need the GNU Readline library installed.  Except for this,
	you can install this module by the standard method, i.e.

		perl Makefile.PL; make install

1.1 Install GNU Readline library 2.1 or later and their header files.

	See the section `How to Install GNU Readline Library'.

1.2 Make and install

	% perl Makefile.PL [--prefix=...] [--includedir=...] [--libdir=...]
	% make
	% make test
	% make install

	If you have installed the GNU Readline Library
	(libreadline.{a,so} and readline/readline.h, etc.) on
	directories for which your perl is not configured to search
	(refer the value of ccflags and libpath in the output of `perl
	-V'), specify the paths as follows;

	% perl Makefile.PL --includedir=/mydir/include --libdir=/mydir/lib

	This example is equivalent to the following;

	% perl Makefile.PL --prefix=/mydir

	If you are not an administrator and cannot install Perl module
	in your system directory, try
		perldoc perlfaq8
	and see the section 'How do I keep my own module/library
	directory?' (This section is found in the Perl 5.6
	documentation).

1.3 Known Issue - Segmentation Fault during exiting Perl.

	If "make test" fails even though all test passed, try
		perl -Mblib t/00checkver.t
	If segmentation fault occurs after all test done, if encounter
	the putenv() bug. You have to recompile Perl with
	-DPERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV.  See
	   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=37194
	for more details.

1.4 Trouble Shooting

        If you have any trouble when using or installing this module,
	please let me (hiroo.hayashi@computer.org) know by E-Mail.  It
	may help other people who have the same problem.  I'm sorry
	that I cannot watch all articles on comp.lang.perl.modules.

	When you report your trouble, be sure to send me the following
	information;
		o result of `perl -V'
		o compiler you used to compile the GNU Readline Library
		  (libreadline.a).
		o terminal emulator which you are using
		o result of `echo $TERM`

2. How to Install GNU Readline Library

	Now this module supports only GNU Readline Library 2.1 and
	later. Executing `perl Makefile.PL` detects which version of
	the GNU Readline Library is already installed and warns you if
	you have the unsupported version.

	In the following example, the install prefix directory is
	`/usr/local/gnu'.
	
	You can specify any directory for the GNU Readline library and
	its header files, by editing `LIBS' and/or `INC' section in
	Makefile.PL.

2.1. Install

	readline-2.2.tar.gz has some bugs, so I strongly recommend you
	to use readline-2.2.1.tar.gz and/or later instead.

	1. get and extract readline-XX.tar.gz

	2. configure
		% ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu
	3. make and install
		% make install

	If you have any reason in which use must use one of the follows;
		readline-2.1
		libreadline.a in bash-2.0.tar.gz
		Cygwin b20.1
	see INSTALL file which is included in Term-ReadLine-Gnu-1.11.

2.2 Shared Library
	!!!Description in this section is old.  See document in the GNU
	Readline Library.!!!

	If you want to build it as shared library, use readline-4.0
	(or later).  Type `make shared' instead of `make' to build
	shared library.

	You HAVE TO build the library as shared library on the
	following OSs;
		HPUX

	You DON'T HAVE TO and may build the library as shared library
	on the following OSs;
		GNU/Linux 2.x
		SunOS 4.x, 5.x
		AIX 4.1.x
		Cygwin 20.x

	# Please let me know on your experience on others OSs.
