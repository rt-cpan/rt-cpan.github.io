DESCRIPTION:More talks: \nLightning Talks Day 2\nLightning Talks Day 3 \n\n
 Schedule:\n\nRunning Perl applications on the Stackato cloud platform\nAll
  Your Code Gonna Git Got\nNavigate with Toto\nTemplate Benchmarks\nSolgeno
 mics : Slicing and Dicing Plant Genomes with Perl\n\nThreading Perl with T
 BB\nSQL so close I can paste it\nOWASP Top 10\ncpandoc: perldoc for module
 s you haven't installed yet\nPittsburgh Perl Workshop\n\nThese Lightning T
 alks may be serious\, funny\, or both.  They may be given by experienced s
 peakers already giving full length talks or by first time speakers just st
 arting out (this is a great way to get started if you have something to sa
 y).  If you are a first time speaker you will win a tie with an experience
  speaker when the schedule is made if it comes to it.  Today's first time 
 speaker could be tomorrow's keynote speaker.\n\nWe will have about 10 Ligh
 tning Talks of 5 minutes each day.  Submit your talk through the submit ta
 lk link on this website.  The first deadline is with the full length talks
  in April.  The second deadline is one week before the conference starts a
 nd many proposals will be accepted.  At least two speaking spots on day 2 
 will be held open until the day before the talks to give you a chance to s
 ee something at the conference and put together a Lightning Talk response.
   However if you wait for the later deadlines note that there are fewer sp
 ots available and you are less likely to be accepted so please try to subm
 it more than a week before the conference.\n\nIn addition to the five minu
 te Lightning Talks where you get to use your computer\, slides\, and any o
 ther tool\, we will also have some Lightning Advertisements.  These are on
 ly 30 seconds\, you don't have to submit a proposal\, you don't get any sl
 ides\, and the only AV assistance offered is a microphone.  If you have a 
 BOF to announce\, an auction item so advertise or any other short message 
 you can use the transition time that would be otherwise wasted between Lig
 htning Talks to share your message.  Just show up before we start and take
  a seat in the assigned seats in the front of the room.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Would
  You Want to do a Lightning Talk?\n\nMaybe you've never given a talk befor
 e\, and you'd like to start small. For a Lightning Talk\, you don't need t
 o make slides\, and if you do decide to make slides\, you only need to mak
 e three.\n\nMaybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a 
 lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute talk than it is to deliver a 
 long talk. And if you do mess up\, at least the painful part will be over 
 quickly.\n\nMaybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a
  question\, or invite people to help you with your project\, or boast abou
 t something you did\, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are a
 ll interesting and worth talking about\, but there might not be enough to 
 say about them to fill up thirty minutes.\n\nMaybe you have a lot of thing
 s to say\, and you're already going to give a long talk on one of them\, a
 nd you don't want to hog the spotlight. There's nothing wrong with giving 
 several Lightning Talks. Hey\, they're only five minutes.\n\nOn the other 
 side\, people might want to come to a lightning talk when they wouldn't co
 me to a long talk on the same subject. The risk for the attendees is small
 er: If the talk turns out to be dull\, or if the person giving the talk tu
 rns out to be a really bad speaker\, well\, at least it's over in five min
 utes. With lightning talks\, you're never stuck in some boring lecture for
  forty-five minutes.\n\nStill having trouble picking a topic\, here are so
 me suggestions:\n\n   1. Why my favorite module is X.\n   2. I want to do 
 cool project X. Does anyone want to help?\n   3. Successful Project: I did
  project X. It was a success. Here's how you could benefit.\n   4. Failed 
 Project: I did project X. It was a failure\, and here's why.\n   5. Heresy
 : People always say X\, but they're wrong. Here's why.\n   6. You All Suck
 : Here's what is wrong with the our community.\n   7. Call to Action: Let'
 s all do more of X / less of X.\n   8. Wouldn't it be cool if X?\n   9. So
 meone needs to do X.\n  10. Wish List\n  11. Why X was a mistake.\n  12. W
 hy X looks like a mistake\, but isn't.\n  13. What it's like to do X.\n  1
 4. Here's a useful technique that worked.\n  15. Here's a technique I thou
 ght would be useful but didn't work.\n  16. Why algorithm X sucks.\n  17. 
 Comparison of algorithms X and Y. \n\nOf course\, you could give the talk 
 on anything you wanted\, whether or not it is on this list. If we get a fu

DESCRIPTION:In 2010 I spent a good amount of time hacking on and using DBIx
 ::Class::Journal.  It is great for getting solid journaling.  What it's no
 t great at is using that data.  My new module\, DBIx::Class::Shadow\, will
  allow much more power\, such as searching for changes\, searching for ver
 sions\, and most importantly\, versioned results will retain all of the re
 lationships of the original results\, allowing you to do clever things lik
 e: $current_artist->versions->back(10)->cds\, giving you the cds of the ar
 tist 10 revisions back.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss how to use this too
 l and hopefully showcase an application that uses it.

DESCRIPTION:After years of writ­ing PHP day in and day out\, I de­cided to 
 take a job writ­ing Perl for the first time. I dove head­first into Perl t
 hink­ing the trans­i­tion would be just a matt­er of a learn­ing a few dif
 ­ferent func­tion names. Perl's sub­tle nuan­ces com­bined with years of h
 ab­bits left me frustrated and con­fused. This talk looks at be­ginn­ing l
 ife as a Perl de­velop­er from a PHP de­veloper's point of view. I'll poin
 t out the bits and pieces that can be dif­ficult to un­derstand when you h
 ave a long his­to­ry with an­oth­er lan­guage. Once de­mis­tified\, you sh
 ould be able to fully un­derstand the flexibil­ity and power of Perl.

DESCRIPTION:This class will cover the basics of Object-Oriented Pro­gramm­i
 ng in Perl\, using Moose for the ex­am­ples. This sess­ion will ex­plain j
 ust what peo­ple mean when they talk about clas­ses\, ob­jects\, in­herita
 n­ce\, attributes\, and more.\n\nThe class will also show you how OO works
  in Perl 5\, though we won't cover all of the gross bits. Instead\, advanc
 ed con­cepts will be il­lustrated using Moose\, an OO framework for Perl 5
 .\n\nPlease note that this is _not_ an in­troduc­tion to Moose. It is aime
 d at peo­ple who are familiar with Perl syn­tax and want to learn what obj
 ect-oriented pro­gramm­ing is all about. If you al­ready un­derstand OO bu

 more stupid) than you could imagine.  As an InfoSec professional\, I'm fru
 strated that my peers have failed to recognize the potential in their SysA
 dmins\, Network Admins\, and Programmers.\n\nThis talk aims to educate you
  to the Brave New World of InfoSec and how you can help improve security w
 ithout crippling your users.\n\nThis talk will focus on the emerging conce
 pt of "Usable Security\," and your place as Perl programmers in it.  Hopef
 ully the Q&A session will be more of a group discussion.

  communicating with the Arduino and Perl. You will learn how to take input
  from the outside world to control events in your Perl programs. You will 
 learn how to control the outside world using Perl. These basic skills will
  open up your I/O world and you will use Perl to glue it together of cours
 e.\n\nMore information about Arduino can be found here\, \nhttp://www.ardu

DESCRIPTION:Say you're writing a system that uses the observer design patte
 rn. What happens if instead of passing around the NAME of an event\, you p
 ass around an OBJECT representing the event? Turns out\, a whole lot of go
 odness!\n\nAnnouncements enable communication from the observer to the obs
 erved\, and even communication (and conspiracy) amongst observers themselv
 es.\n\nAll with a very strongly object-oriented\, antler-shaped flavor.

DESCRIPTION:I architected and implemented a multi-million dollar eCommerce 
 system using the cream of the Perl crop. We joined the community\, contrib
 uted to projects and have succeeded in deploying a stable\, high performan
 ce site. Now let me tell you all the shit I did wrong. Deadlocks\, forgott
 en features\, data loss\, lack of reporting\, terrible schemas and general
  nincompoopery will assist you as we take a whirlwind tour of how NOT to b
 uild the future of your company. Revel in my trials and tribulations as I 
 lament poor database structure\, bad team management and terrible developm
 ent practices. Maybe you'll learn from my failures. I've taken the time to
  point out some lessons learned while I was at it. It wasn't all bad and i
 t's my hope that you will benefit from my mistakes.

DESCRIPTION:Perl events come in all shapes and sizes ranging from tiny hack
 athons to a full-fledged YAPC's.\n\nIn this talk\, I will cover various le
 ssons learned from years of running Perl events.   I'll reveal some often 
 hidden pitfalls and outline methods for success in running your event.  I 
 will also cover some of the resources that are available to help you run y
 our event.\n\nAudience:  Perl experience isn't really relevant to this tal
 k.   This talk is suited for anybody that has an interest\, but little exp
 erience in event organizing.\n\nBio:  As a founding organizer for The Pitt
 sburgh Perl Workshop\, I know first-hand what it is like to run an event f
 or the first time.   Since 2006\, I've organized 4 PPW's and a YAPC.   Cur
 rently\, I am planning for PPW 2011 and also serving as Treasurer for The 
 Perl Foundation.

DESCRIPTION:Don't wander around your first YAPC clueless.  Learn a few secr
 ets to get the most of the conference.\n\n---\n\n\nIntroducing the permane
 nt Beginner Track for YAPC.  If all goes to plan these talks\, or somethin
 g very close to them\, will be given each year at YAPC.  When first put on
  the schedule these talks are listed as being given by “Your Name Here”\, 
 but it could be replaced with your name as speaker.\n\nThe slides will be 
 passed on from one conference to the next.  Each new speaker will then hav
 e the chance to make small changes to make the talk their own but the hard
  part will already be done.  This first year there are no slides to start 
 from so it might be wise to have the YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe speakers co
 llaborate on the initial set with the help of their mentors.\n\nAre you lo
 oking to break into speaking at YAPC?  Having trouble finding clever new t
 hings to talk about?  Then volunteer to present one of the topics on the B
 eginner Track.  These topic may not be as cool as those on the bleeding ed
 ge of sanity\, but they are still important.  These beginner talks will fi
 nd a new audience of beginners each year in need of their content.\n\nAre 
 you an experienced speaker willing to mentor the next generation of speake
 rs and keep our community vibrant?  Then volunteer to help a speaker prepa
 re for their talk.  After our new speakers succeed with your help\, they w
 ill be more confident in the future when they do have something clever to 
 say.\n\nHave your given a presentation similar to one of the Beginner Trac
 k talks?  Do you have some slides to contribute to the Beginner Track for 
 their first conference season?  Then please offer them to this season’s sp
 eakers to get the Beginner Track off to a good start.\n\nFor more informat
 ion go to irc://irc.perl.org/yapc.\n\nTo present or mentor one of the Begi
 nner Track talks please submit a talk using the normal 'Submit a talk prop
 osal' link on menu to the right.  Set your talk title to 'Beginner Track S
 peaker' or 'Beginner Track Mentor' and in the comment section give your fi
 rst and second choice and any comments you think will help the organizers 
 assign talks.

 t you in the mindset necessary to write effective documentation.\n\nWe wil
 l briefly touch on POD (Plain Old Documentation) syntax\, but due to its e
 legant simplicity we can quickly move on to examine the bigger picture\, a
 nd explore the decisions we face when writing documentation.\n\nSome key p
 oints will include:\n- Conventions and expectations\n- APIs\, Tutorials\, 
 Manuals\, and Cookbooks... and why you should keep them separate.\n- Writi
 ng POD to take full advantage of formatters (e.g. Pod::LaTeX\, Pod::HTML)\

DESCRIPTION:Perl has a long history of automated testing\, as well as great
  tools to support\nthat testing. Someone new to Perl or new to testing mig
 ht wonder why they would\n"waste" time on testing when there's so much cod
 e to write.\n\nIn this short talk\, we'll cover the basics of the Test Any
 thing Protocol\, the\nTest::More module and how to use them to your benefi
 t. We'll also talk about\nthe benefits to the developer of testing code. F
 inally\, we'll touch on test\ncoverage with Devel::Cover.\n\nBy the end of
  the talk\, you should know how to use Test::More and other Test::*\nmodul
 es and have some idea how automated testing helps improve your code and\nd
 ocument your interfaces and intentions.

DESCRIPTION:Accessing a database at process startup for static information 
 is common\, but can be hard on the database in a production environment. A
 nother bad alternative is re-checking the data status every time it is use
 d. An AUTOLOAD can handle the issue by lazily installing the sub\, but mak
 es it impossible to use can.\n\nLexical variables and a one-shot subtrouin
 e to load them offer a nice\, clean\, private way to handle lazy data acqu
 isition: put the permanent handler and data structure in lexical variables
 \, and have the subroutine replace itself after the first call.

DESCRIPTION:The jackalope is a mythical animal of North American folklore (
 a so-called "fearsome critter") described as a jackrabbit with antelope ho
 rns or deer antlers and sometimes a pheasant's tail (and often hind legs).
  The word jackalope is a portmanteau of "jackrabbit" and "antalope"\, an a
 rchaic spelling of antelope.\n\nJackalope is also the name of a RESTish we
 b-services framework that I am currently working on.

DESCRIPTION:Parrot Virtual Machine is a seemingly-complex piece of software
  that dedicated\nhackers have been working on for over ten years. It curre
 ntly has mature\nimplementations of Perl 6 and Lua\, and many dozens of in
 -progress\nimplementations for every language under the sun.\n\nBecause Pa
 rrot development moves fast\, the documentation for any given\nsubsystem i
 s sometimes lagging. It can be hard for a newcomer to understand how\nall 
 the pieces fit together.\n\nI propose to fix this problem by providing a "
 Visual Introduction" to Parrot\,\nwhich will focus on information-dense pi
 ctures that show how the different\nparts of Parrot fit together.\n\nThe f
 irst half of the talk will focus on what the building blocks of Parrot\nar
 e\, and how they fit together\, while the second half of the talk will\nco
 ncentrate on how languages built on Parrot (known as High Level Languages 
 or\nHLLs) interact with the virtual machine.\n\nAttendees of this talk wil
 l leave with a valuable understanding of how Parrot\nand HLLs on Parrot wo
 rk that will be useful for years to come\, instead of being\ntold a bunch 
 of details that will be quickly obsoleted.

DESCRIPTION:Slides and notes at:  http://www.pimpyourmacwithperl.com/\n\nAs
  a Perl Programmer you are the ultimate Mac power user - using a few simpl
 e techniques you can apply what you already know to automate your Mac with
  Perl.  Avoid the rigmarole non programmers must suffer in day to day task
 s and empower your Mac to act autonomously on the grunt work so you don't 
 have to.\n\nIn this session we will be briefly covering techniques to: \n\
 n- Create new services to consume\, produce or manipulate text anywhere on
  your system\n- Trigger scripts from utilities like TextMate\, TextExpande
 r\, QuickSilver and LaunchBar\n- Write Plack powered local web tools and s
 tarting these whenever you log in \n- Configuring launchd to run Perl scri
 pts periodically to deal with stuff so you don't have to\n- Efficiently wa
 tch directories for changes and take action using FSEvents\n- Run AppleScr
 ipt from within Perl to control other applications\n- Manipulate the conte

DESCRIPTION:As Parrot’s architect\, I have an exciting view of the potentia
 l that Parrot has\nto change how developers look at dynamic languages. Unf
 ortunately there are\nseveral barriers that Parrot’s community needs to ov
 ercome to turn our\npotential awesomeness into actual awesomeness. I’ll ta
 lk about where Parrot’s\nbeen\, what we’re doing now and where I see Parro
 t going in the future\, both as\na platform for language development and e
 xperimentation and as a product for\nembedding into other\, sometimes surp
 rising\, applications. Satellites may be\ninvolved.\n\nIn the retrospectiv
 e\, I’ll touch on some of our successes and some of the\nproblems we’ve de
 alt with. Rakudo Perl 6 has been an excellent user\, both by\nrequiring a 
 stable platform for development and by exposing bugs in our code\nand proc
 esses\, which I’ll cover. Our current policy and tools for dealing with\nd
 eprecations were motivated largely by Rakudo. They’ve also necessitated a 
 move\nto a more sophisticated automated testing infrastructure capable of\
 nintelligently tracking updates and dependencies and reporting failures.\n
 (currently a wip)\n\nI’ll also talk about our series of low-level redesign
 s and rewrites known\ncollectively as “Lorito” and what they’ll mean for P
 arrot’s users. Lorito is\nessentially a microcode-like set of very simple 
 instructions on top of which\nthe bulk of Parrot will be implemented. I’ll
  cover the design inspirations for\nLorito and the benefits that our users
 . This will include a 10\,000 foot view of\nLorito and its meta-object mod
 el\, based on Jonathan Worthington’s 6model work.\nI’ll take a high-level 
 look at our roadmap and talk what’s been done and what\nremains.\n\nIf any
  time is left\, I’ll talk about what we’ve got in the pipeline and show\no
 ff what our hackers have been doing.

DESCRIPTION:Update: I have started a github repo with the code examples fro
 m the talk here: https://github.com/Hercynium/anyevent-examples. I hope to
  add more over time and would love to get more from anybody who wants to a
 dd anything!\n\nAsynchronous programming is oft considered a black art\, a
 nd in many ways it is. In any event (pun intended!)\, as is usually the ca
 se with Perl\, there are many ways to do it.\n\nWhy choose one toolkit or 
 framework over another? That's part of the challenge. Event-based programm
 ing doesn't have to be hard or even painful\, and it's not... once you've 
 wrapped your head around it and understand what's going on. In my opinion\
 , one of the main factors in your choice should be your comfort level with
  the fundamentals of the framework you choose.\n\nThis talk is intended to
  be a tutorial for those who want to get up-end-running with AnyEvent\, be
 yond the trivial examples and code-snippets available in the documentation
  and other tutorials out on the web. First\, we'll cover the core ideas be
 hind its design and API\, and then we'll step through how one goes about w
 riting a simple\, fully-asynchronous application. As we go along\, I'll po
 int out some good practices\, techniques\, and how to avoid the pitfalls a
 nd subtleties that can lead to frustration and confusion.\n\nPlease be awa
 re that in order to understand the content of this talk you will need to h
 ave a firm grasp on closures\, lexical scope\, and basic perl OO.

DESCRIPTION:As any open source project that leverages the power of the CPAN
  or other\ndependency rich sources knows\, streamlining installation for y
 our users\nis critical.  Many of our projects can requires 100+ dependenci
 es from\nCPAN plus the C libraries that they depend on.  Shipwright lets y
 ou pick\nspecific versions of CPAN modules to include\, avoiding interesti
 ng bugs\nthat occur when new versions of a module remove or subtly break a
 \nfeature you were relying on.  You can ship relocatable binary\ndistribut
 ions for particular platforms or ship a vessel that includes\neverything (
 including a known-good version of the perl interpreter) to\nbe built by th
 e end user on their particular platform of choice.\n\nShipwright vessels a
 re tracked in a version control system such as\nsubversion or git and allo
 w you to record local tweaks to modules\nrequired to work around an upstre
 am bug or a required local modification\n(such as a patch submitted upstre
 am but not yet applied). \nYou can import your local modules on top of the
 ir requirements from\nCPAN.  If you need tweaks to configure or build line
 s in order to\naccommodate your local environment\, you can easily add the
 m to a\nper-dependency build script.  Once you're done building your vesse
 l\, you\ncan ship it around as a distribution package or puppet it out to 
 your\nservers.  \n\nWhen you're ready to release your next version\, take 
 the existing source\nrepository and begin importing updated versions of yo
 ur modules and new\ndependencies.  Test your app against new versions of l
 ibraries before\nadding them to your blessed vessel for deployment.  When 
 managing a farm\nof servers\, be confident that every machine is using the
  same version of\nyour application and its dependencies.  \n\nMore than an
 ything else\, Shipwright allows modern perl applications to\navoid the "in
 stalling half of CPAN" stigma that can frustrate and drive\naway users and
  make sysadmins pull our their hair debugging weird\nintegration issues.

DESCRIPTION:*We* know Perl is powerful\, pragmatic\, and pleasant--whether 
 we're munging data\, running websites\, automating processes\, or building
  the next big thing. We happily install (and occasionally upload) the late
 st and greatest of CPAN. We know whose books and articles and blogs to rea
 d. We lurk on the right mailing lists and idle on the popular IRC channels
  and even share meals at YAPCs.\n\nHow do we tell the rest of the world--P
 erl programmers and otherwise--that they too can write great programs with
  Perl\, whether Perl 5 or Perl 6?\n\nLearn what you can do to explain why 
 it's never been a better time to write Perl.

DESCRIPTION:I am planning to create an XML based Twitter client for the SEN
  (Siemens Enterprise) Openstage 60/80 phones using a web application frame
 work called Perl Catalyst. The main idea is that the user should be able t
 o display her timeline\, mentions\, and direct messages directly on the ph
 one. As entering text using the phone keys would be too awkward in my opin
 ion there are no plans to implement a possibility to send tweets using the
  application at the moment.\nBecause of the limitations the Openstage’s so
 ftware imposes\, users will have to create an account for the application 
 using a web interface and connect it to twitter using OAuth. From then on 
 they can log into the application using the phone and will get a periodica
 lly updated view of their information using three tabs.\nUsing this exampl
 e I want to show that it is possible to implement Openstage XML applicatio
 ns using of-the-shelf web frameworks and that there are alternatives to us
 ing Java as backend technology.

DESCRIPTION:A head-to-head comparison of several disparate concurrency mana
 gement systems in Perl5. Strengths? Weaknesses? Cats? Dogs? You decide.\n\
 nCurrent plan: Quick survey and overview of Poe\, Reflex\, Coro\, and AnyE
 vent (and maybe another few). Then some carefully selected code-to-code st
 udies to illustrate the relationships and structures of each. Finally we'l
 l hook them all up together a few different ways and see what explodes.\n\
 nSadly\, nperez won't be joining us this time after all :(

DESCRIPTION:Chip has a great day job.  But his nights-and-weekends project 
 is a little game server written in event-driven modern Perl\, with modern 
 web technology.\n\nThe server has lots of tough jobs:   It has to support 
 any game with a smart client and no hard round-trip time limit.   It has t
 o scale up to at least a million simultaneous users without instance shard
 s.  It has to make efficient use of virtual cloud servers like Amazon's EC
 2 (those things are expensive!).  And\, by the time of YAPC11\, it has to 
 already be running.  Will it be?  I don't know about you\, but the suspens
 e is killing *me*.  :-)\n\nCome learn how modern Perl\, event-driven Perl\
 , modern Perl web technology\, and a general purpose game model come toget
 her into a client-agnostic web-scale game server of awesome.\n\nPS: If the
  game has gone live I'll demo it.  If not\, I'll have some cool war storie
 s.  Either way\, you win!

 its field) whose technical platform is driven by Perl\,    \nand look what
  "business skills" they require from their programmers. \n\nWe will see th

 diagramming tool for AT&T Business Services. Perl provided text parsing\, 
 database access\, an interface to the Graphviz graph visualization tool\, 
 and a web-services interface to the tool's front end. It also reduced fina
 l-semester stress by several orders of magnitude. I describe the project's
  progress and celebrate Perl's ability to integrate a giant pile of enabli
 ng technologies\, making the impossible merely difficult.

DESCRIPTION:Most asynchronous Perl programming is unnecessarily dynamic.  I
 t conflicts with object orientation\, and it reintroduces memory managemen
 t issues that some of us learned Perl to escape.\n\nReflex is a flexible\,
  contemporary asynchronous library that embraces the latest developments i
 n Perl object orientation.  Asynchronous classes can be snapped together a
 t coding time\, reducing the amount of anonymous code that's often slung a
 round at runtime.  Methods are first-class callbacks in Reflex\; they can 
 be augmented and overridden using normal Perl OO.  Mixing in Moose make th
 ings even better.\n\nThis presentation is an expanded\, more code-intensiv
 e version of my Perl Oasis talk.  It will cover the 6.5 ways Reflex-based 
 modules can be used\, including anonymous callback and closure juggling\, 
 and mind-bogglingly powerful Moose-fueled OO crack.  Imperative promises a
 re included for people who just want to do one simple thing without muckin
 g about with callbacks at all.\n\nYou will get the most out of this talk i
 f you already understand fundamental Perl OO.  You've encountered callback
 s at least once\, but it was dark\, and you might not have got a good look
  at them.  You enjoy learning new things---possibly things that haven't ex
 isted before.  And you can at least look at Moose syntax without shudderin
 g.

DESCRIPTION:As with many programming languages\, it’s very easy to find Per
 l code that can best be described as “write only”. Cute tricks\, short var
 iable names\, inconsistent spacing\, dubious reliance on default arguments
 … Even without the added challenge of a whole extra embedded language (reg
 ular expressions)\, some Perl programs deserve to be referred to as line-n
 oise.\n\nYet Perl is a beautiful\, expressive language that can be used su
 ccessfully by novices through to experts to achieve powerful results\; and
 \, with a little extra preparation can be easy to read\, fun to work with\
 , and a joy to maintain.\n\nPerl has come a very long way even in the last
  6 years since Dr Conway's Perl Best Practices book was published. This ta
 lk will provide a lightning tour of the current status of Perl's best prac
 tices using many of the ideas from Modern Perl.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose\, an
  OO system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of "sugar" 
 on top of a powerful\, extensible meta-model.\n\nWith Moose\, simple class
 es can be created without writing any subroutines\, and complex classes ca
 n be simplified. Moose's features include a powerful attribute declaration
  system\, type constraints and coercions\, method modifiers ("before"\, "a
 fter"\, and "around")\, a role system (like mixins on steroids)\, and more
 . Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety 
 of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.\n\nThis course will cover Moose's core featur
 es\, go in depth on many of them\, and explore some of the more powerful M
 ooseX:: modules available on CPAN.\n\nStudents are expected to bring a lap
 top\, as you will be writing code during the class. You will also be provi
 ded with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled. This will c
 ontain the exercises for the class.

DESCRIPTION:This course covers using and creating modules for your code.  T
 his course assumes you are familiar with basic Perl syntax\, subroutines a
 nd conditionals.\n\nYou will learn:\n\n  * about CPAN and how to install C
 PAN modules both in system  directories and locally\;\n  * how to write an
 d use Perl modules and packages\;\n  * how to use Module::Starter to start
  your modules off on the right foot\;\n  * how to test your modules with T
 est::More\;\n  * about coverage testing and how to improve your tests' cov
 erage\;\n  * about using Perl::Critic to evaluate and improve your module 
 code.\n\nThis is a hands on course where you will be writing a module from
  scratch\, using Module::Starter and writing tests.  Attendees are request
 ed to bring a laptop with Perl installed for the full day.

DESCRIPTION:A good programmer needs many qualities: intelligence\, foresigh
 t\, dedication\,\nand the ability to fight off a hundred angry targh armed
  only with your\nbat'leth. On Qo'noS\, software developers undertake an in
 tensive course in\ncombat programming before they are cleared for active d
 uty. The tlhIngan\ntraditions have long known one truth holds true for bot
 h glory in battle and\nsoftware development:\n\nbIlujDI' yIchegh()Qo'\; yI
 Hegh()!\n\nIt is better to die() than to return() in failure.\n\nFor too l
 ong\, Perl has been a pujwI'\, and unsuitable for use by true\nwarriors. I
 n this talk we will show how the new autodie pragma can help you\nto code 
 with batlh!
