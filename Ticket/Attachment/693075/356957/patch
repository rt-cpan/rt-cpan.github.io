 the child in question closes its inputs or takes input from 
 unfiltered SCALARs or named files.  Normally, a child inherits its STDIN

 If data is sent to the child from CODE refs, filehandles or from
 scalars through filters than the child's outputs will not be optimized
 because C<optimize()> assumes the parent is interacting with the child.
