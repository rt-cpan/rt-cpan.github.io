# This script runs as a cron job every minute or longer.
# This script creates a three files; a last-read file; a history file; a feature-state file.
# See initialization below.
# The feature-state file is delivered to the user's browser by a cgi script.
# changes: Nov 4, 2009 migrate from basic read paradigm to general paradigm
