Looks good
Warning: PERL_LIB (../lib/5.14.2) seems not to be a perl library directory
        (strict.pm not found) at /export/home/a273121/test/perl5/elsewhere/perl/lib/5.14.2/ExtUtils/MM_Unix.pm line 1735.
Have /export/home/a273121/test/perl5/elsewhere/perl/lib/5.14.2/aix-64int
Want ../lib/5.14.2/aix-64int
Your perl and your Config.pm seem to have different ideas about the
architecture they are running on.
Perl thinks: [aix-64int]
Config says: [aix-64int]
This may or may not cause problems. Please check your installation of perl
if you have problems building this extension.
