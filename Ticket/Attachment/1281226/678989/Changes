Revision history for Perl module PDL::IO::Nifti

0.70    2013-10-30

    *   Nifti now uses PDL as base class, making use of the PDL hash
        key for the data! This means that any Nifti object is also a
        piddle, this could break code!  

    *   for typemapping, I used get_datatype, but since the numbers seem
        to be rather arbitray, this was changed to using type().


0.60    2013-09-04

    *   important bug fixes


0.52    2013-05-10

    *   First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
