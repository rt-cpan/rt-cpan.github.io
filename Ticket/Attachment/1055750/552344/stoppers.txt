When I install Bundle::CPAN, there appear to be no problems.

When I install Task-Tom without patching File::MMagic, I get the
following failures:

 INGY/YAML-0.80.tar.gz                        : make_test NO
    The failure is in t/dump-perl-types.t, and is not related to
    File::MMagic as far as I can tell; it appears to be related to how
    'use strict' is decompiles. Think I forced this on the last install.
 CHORNY/Test-Warn-0.23.tar.gz                 : make_test NO
    Not sure what is going on here -- seems to be related to STDERR
    handling, not File::MMagic. Think I forced this on the last install.
 OVID/Test-Most-0.25.tar.gz                   : make_test NO one dependency not OK (Test::Warn); additionally test harness failed
    Fails because Test::Warn fails.
 LETO/Math-MatrixReal-2.09.tar.gz             : make_test NO one dependency not OK (Test::Most); additionally test harness failed
     Relies on Test::Most.
 SDRABBLE/HTML-TableContentParser-0.13.tar.gz : make_test NO
     Relies on bug fixed in 5.9.something. Not patched because YAML not
     installed.
 /Users/tom/Code/perl/Task-Tom/.              : make_test NO 3 dependencies missing (YAML,Math::MatrixReal,HTML::TableContentParser)

After the above, I force-installed YAML and Test::Warn, and the rest of
the failures installed without problems.

When I instal Task-Tom-Devel without patching File::MMagic, I get the
following failures:

Failed during this command:
 CHORNY/Module-CPANTS-Analyse-0.85.tar.gz     : make_test NO
     Failed because of errors thrown in File::MMagic
 CHROMATIC/Test-Kwalitee-1.01.tar.gz          : make_test NO one dependency not OK (Module::CPANTS::Analyse); additionally test harness failed
 /Users/tom/Code/perl/Task-Tom-Devel/.        : make_test NO one dependency not OK (Test::Kwalitee)
