<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Hello,

first of all thank you for the tcl::pTk module and for actively supporting
it.

This is probably not a bug, but installation fails on a macOS &#40;using
Perlbrew&#41;, because the module Sub::Name is missing. After installing
separately this module, the installation of tcl::pTk works fine. Maybe this
could be fixed &#40;probably it is the reason it fails by the testers?&#41;.

An idea: why not create a mailing list or similar to share ideas/problems
working with this module?

Best,
welle

There was a issue reported a couple years ago (<a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116432">RT #116432</a>) where Sub::Name was missing from the list of needed dependencies; the code was fixed rightaway, but was only recently released in Tcl::pTk 0.93.<br>

I&#39;m not familiar with Perlbrew (I&#39;ve used MacPorts primarily), but I would imagine that the underlying cpan/cpanm command can be used find and install any Perl dependencies if it doesn&#39;t do so automatically.<br>

I recently found out about the tcltk@perl.org mailing list through Vadim Konovalov (maintainer of Tcl.pm and Tcl::Tk); he says it is open to use for any Perl modules related to Tcl/Tk (Tcl.pm, Tcl::Tk, Tcl::pTk, and Tkx).

I haven&#39;t looked at all the tester&#39;s reports but most have &quot;unknown&quot; results because those might not have Tcl/Tk installed.&nbsp;The 3 failure reports have Tcl/Tk but fail during tests, some of which have issues already reported.</span><br>

<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Hi Christopher,

thank you again for putting new life into this module &#40;greatest tk module
for macOS&#41;!

Nice to know that the missing module has being fixed in the new release &#40;I
am still using 0.92, but will soon update it&#41;.

I do not know if the tcltk@perl.org mailing list is the right place for
what I was thinking of, as it seems to be mostly related to bugs, changes
in the code, etc, i.e. for maintainers or very advanced users. I was
thinking more about a place where to share best practices, ask for
questions, etc. targeting more the average user. If not a mailing list,
maybe a small forum, or something like this. I think this would contribute
to more exposure for this module which - as I believe - is for the macOS
world maybe the best available solution to create modern Tk UI using Perl.
Or probably it could be extended to all the aspects around this module,
such as Tcl frameworks, widget differences between perl/tk and
tcl/tk through tcl::pTk &#40;for example now I am using ttkButton instead of
Button as it gives a more native look to the UI, but I do not know if every
user would come to this idea&#41;, and much more. Being the
module actively maintained now, I guess some people may find it useful.

If you think it could be of any use, I could try to put something online
myself.

Best,
Welle

There has been quite a bit of dev-related traffic on the list recently, but I assure you there are user-related questions there as well. I will still ask if it&#39;s a good idea to have separate lists for user- and dev-related threads.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">For anything I think is definitely a bug, I&#39;m inclined to go straight to RT to open a ticket.</span><br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Indeed I&#39;ve noticed that many of this module&#39;s other active users are also trying to get Perl/Tk programs working on macOS aqua. It would be nice to have something more centralized for discussing it so we all know what&#39;s going on. Or, if there&#39;s a question or thread posted somewhere, that it at least gets mentioned on that central forum so other users are then aware. I&#39;m not sure what the best way of doing this would be.<br>

<br>

At the moment users including myself have resorted to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">very busy platforms like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=tcl%3A%3Aptk">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node=tcl%3A%3Aptk">Perlmonks</a> because</span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;that&#39;s been where to ask those who (1) are knowledgeable about all things Perl (though not necessarily Tcl::pTk) or (2) will give answers quickly.<br>

<br>

Those sites are not without issues; I&#39;m particularly concerned about friendliness to new members.<br>

<br>

And since StackOverflow doesn&#39;t yet have a dedicated tag for Tcl::pTk, nor does&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Perlmonks seems to have a &quot;subscribe to topic&quot; feature at all</span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, I will have to manually remind myself to manually search those sites for any Tcl::pTk-related questions on a regular basis, since I&#39;m not constantly on them. This evening I managed to reply to a few questions on those sites, but I wish I was aware of them when they were first asked a month or two ago, so that others would&#39;ve been aware of what were already issues I had reported on RT and not needlessly spent time investigating.<br>

<br>

There&#39;s also the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/lists/tcl-mac">tcl-mac@lists.sourceforge.net</a><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;mailing list for any upstream Tcl/Tk on Mac questions. It hasn&#39;t gotten much traffic in the past few years, so maybe there&#39;s other avenues for assistance that other users have taken instead.<br>

<br>

Another related effort will be to modernize the repository used by Tcl::pTk and have it listed by metaCPAN.org. Currently there&#39;s an <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/perl-tcl-ptk/code/HEAD/tree/">SVN repository on Sourceforge</a>, but migrating to Git and then having the repository at least mirrored on other platforms like GitHub should help in terms of visibility.<br>

</div><br>

This could probably go well either in the documentation for Tcl::pTk, or in a Wiki of some sort. Maybe adding screenshots for comparison and detailing any differences in what&#39;s available in Tcl/Tk 8.5.9 (which is what recent macOS includes) and 8.6.8 (the latest version available).</span><br>

<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Thank you for your answer. Yes, it would be nice to have a place where we
could share experiences and working examples using tcl::pTk on a Mac &#40;I
guess it is the OS for which this module is VERY interesting&#41;. For now it
is all a &#34;try out&#34; experience. Since I am working on a big project porting
a Tk application to macOS with tcl::pTk I have collected a lot of
experience which would be nice to pass over, and to learn from other &#40;more
experienced&#41; users, of course. The fact that tcl::pTk has gone some way
noticed in the past &#40;I assume it by the low number of questions on the web&#41;
makes difficult to use perlmonks and other general Perl platforms &#40;of
course I will ask questions there too&#41;.

If you have any ideas, I&#39;ll be happy to help.

&gt;
&gt; There has been quite a bit of dev-related traffic on the list recently,
&gt; but I
&gt; assure you there are user-related questions there as well. I will still
&gt; ask if
&gt; it&#39;s a good idea to have separate lists for user- and dev-related threads.
&gt; For
&gt; anything I think is definitely a bug, I&#39;m inclined to go straight to RT to
&gt; open
&gt; a ticket.
&gt;
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; If not a mailing list, maybe a small forum, or something like this. I
</div>&gt; think
&gt; this would contribute to more exposure for this module which - as I
&gt; believe -
&gt; is for the macOS world maybe the best available solution to create modern
&gt; Tk UI
&gt; using Perl.
&gt;
&gt; Indeed I&#39;ve noticed that many of this module&#39;s other active users are also
&gt; trying to get Perl/Tk programs working on macOS aqua. It would be nice to
&gt; have
&gt; something more centralized for discussing it so we all know what&#39;s going
&gt; on.
&gt; Or, if there&#39;s a question or thread posted somewhere, that it at least gets
&gt; mentioned on that central forum so other users are then aware. I&#39;m not sure
&gt; what the best way of doing this would be.
&gt;
&gt; At the moment users including myself have resorted to very busy platforms
&gt; like
&gt; StackOverflow and Perlmonks because that&#39;s been where to ask those who &#40;1&#41;
&gt; are
&gt; knowledgeable about all things Perl &#40;though not necessarily Tcl::pTk&#41; or

&gt;
&gt; There&#39;s also the tcl-mac@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list for any
