I&#39;ve been guilty of that myself in a few places.

I&#39;m not sure how this can be supported, but I hope it is okay to add tobyink of Exporter::Tiny, as this might simply be a feature / doc request for Exporter::Tiny as well. I can imagine this is quite a common problem for people switching their dists from Exporter to Exporter::Tiny.

List::MoreUtils::all&#40;&#41; is a function call, not a method call, and a well established way to call functions in Perl. The documentation of List::MoreUtils never discouraged its usage.

How about the one that was current as of 0.33? It worked well enough for what we have been doing with it?

The reason of developer releases is also to gather feedback from the community, utilize the smoke tests and to try not to break to much stuff of other people. Here is your feedback: this change would potentially break at least 2,252 [1] CPAN modules in a really hard to track down fashion.

Even if Moose adapts to the new way of doing things, pulling List::MoreUtils 0.40 into an existing library with an older version of Moose would render the whole library almost unusable with no clear indication of what is needed to fix it. Is this really what you want just to teach people that they should not break encapsulation?

It neither discouraged using List::MoreUtils::bootstrap - nevertheless you might accept that it&#39;s not possible to discourage all possible side-effects.

You might also agree to the general assumption that it&#39;s not possible to discourage everything unintended usage.

No. Read RT#40905 for reasons.

I have to make a choice: braking behaviour of documented usage or possible break behavior of undocumented usage. Now I know, I break behavior of undocumented usage - but to be true: I read your concern and I say: there&#39;re ways to work around using namespace::clean, relying on List::MoreUtils::Impl::* etc.

Pick one - but do not blame me for that, sorry.

Stop flaming - and we might be able to find a solution. I don&#39;t argue in that tone.

You&#39;re going to rely on undocumented feature - and now you that bites you and you want me taking responsibility of it? Sorry!.

<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">I don&#39;t see this as an Exporter::Tiny issue, as no exporting is being done.

It&#39;s an issue with the overall design of LMU 0.4x, where there is no longer a List::MoreUtils::all&#40;&#41; function that can be called.

One solution would be for List::MoreUtils to provide an AUTOLOAD function that could delegate to an appropriate implementation of the function. However, this would be unnecessarily slow &#40;introduces an extra level of sub call&#41;, and fragile if people are doing stuff like:

    my $all = UNIVERSAL::can&#40;&#39;List::MoreUtils&#39;, &#39;all&#39;&#41;;
    $all-&gt;&#40;$coderef, @list&#41;;

A better solution would be for LMU to just import its own functions so that it can offer them under their fully-qualified names.

Just add this somewhere to MoreUtil.pm:

    __PACKAGE__-&gt;import&#40; -all &#41;;

I accept that. Where we disagree is that calling a function via its full
namespace instead of importing it into your own is in any way unusual or
undocumented. From time to time I also have seen it encouraged to keep your
namespace clean without depending on namespace::clean and friends.

We agree that it is broken, I just think it is possible to fix it

Thanks for applying the fix for 0.400.

I still have problems seeing your rational for removing the possibility of using List::MoreUtils via require. As far as I can tell importing LMU into its own namespace solves everything cleanly and with just one line of code &#40;and two lines of comments explaining why it is done&#41;.

With this fix, the somewhat wide-spread usage of LMU as
  require List::MoreUtils; List::MoreUtils::all&#40;[...]&#41;;
&#40;and variations thereof&#41; is functionally equivalent to
  use List::MoreUtils qw/:all/; all&#40;[...]&#41;;
Isn&#39;t that what you want?

Keep in mind, that there are use-cases in which the reliance
on -&gt;import is at least impractical. E.g.:

  require List::MoreUtils;
  my $class = Moose::Meta::Class-&gt;create&#40; Foo =&gt; &#40;
    methods =&gt; { bar =&gt; sub{ List::MoreUtils::all&#40;[...]&#41;; }}
  &#41;&#41;;

is straight-forward, while I am having a hard time figuring out how to do same sanely with import. I don&#39;t say it can&#39;t be done &#40;I see at least three more complicated ways of achieving similar results&#41;, I&#39;m just trying to show you an in my opinion perfectly legitimate way to use LMU that relies on require instead of -&gt;import. Granted: this particular piece of code would work with -&gt;import, but only because perl would resolve &#38;all to mean &#38;__PACKAGE__::all which seems very fragile to me, breaks all kinds of best encapsulation practices and would e.g. prohibit having an &#39;all&#39; function in the &#34;host&#34; namespace.

As I said, I don&#39;t see a compelling reason to get rid of require, and at least a few reasons &#40;potentially breaking tons of legacy installs is just the biggest&#41; to keep it around.

Cheers,
  Sebastian

And if it would be acceptable to switch immediately from the broken API back to the original one without breaking other modules, I would agree. But thanks to - let’s say an accident - we’re now in trouble and that causes the loose-loose-situation you’ve also joined :&#41;

And &#34;but many modules needs ...“ is an argument for both sides. 0.4xx has the approach to give ages users a way to keep their environments sane and their algorithms stable as well as don’t break well maintained recent code.

Unfortunately permitting the „require“ use-case will pretend a kind of safety and/or stability which isn’t there.

I hope I could help you with those explanations - additionally I added a rough overview to 0.400_004 pod and don’t intend to remove quickly.

TL;DR:
* as Tassilo I have the approach to do the things &#34;right“ - not easy.
* this means reverting introduced API pollution
* this means breaking code relying on documented behavior when doing the easy way &#40;one function, use == require+import&#41;

You stil seem to misunderstand me. I don&#39;t want to keep the broken state of version 0.33, I just want to have the functions that are exported by &#39;use List::MoreUtils qw/:all/;&#39; to be also available via the List::MoreUtils namespace so they can be used via require. I can&#39;t see how this would impede your ability to change the API or the implementation details at will, it will just keep lots of code that is already out there running &#40;in almost all cases&#41;. 

In a nutshell, I am arguing that the next version of List::MoreUtils should still be usable when loaded at run-time, which has been the case since the dawn of time &#40;like 10 years ago when it was first released&#41;.

<div class="message-stanza open">&gt;&gt;&gt; I still have problems seeing your rational for removing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility of using List::MoreUtils via require. As far as I can
&gt;&gt;&gt; tell importing LMU into its own namespace solves everything cleanly
&gt;&gt;&gt; and with just one line of code &#40;and two lines of comments explaining
&gt;&gt;&gt; why it is done&#41;.
</div>&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; This has to do with the history and the API breakage by self-
&gt;&gt; volunteered maintainer.
&gt;&gt; I now have to cleanup the mess he left - and I had to make a choice.
&gt;&gt; While ether and ribasushi voted strongly against immediate API change,
&gt;&gt; the only other option was a depreciation of the broken API and a slow
&gt;&gt; move while giving users the option to choose.
</div>&gt; 
&gt; You stil seem to misunderstand me. I don&#39;t want to keep the broken state of version 0.33, I just want to have the functions that are exported by &#39;use List::MoreUtils qw/:all/;&#39; to be also available via the List::MoreUtils namespace so they can be used via require. I can&#39;t see how this would impede your ability to change the API or the implementation details at will, it will just keep lots of code that is already out there running &#40;in almost all cases&#41;. 
</div>
This implies not recognizing when things change. I also intend to remove &#39;:all‘ sooner or later, to force people making their choice.
But I also listen to your arguments &#40;as well as to ether and ribasushi&#41; who say: „keep behavior“ - and try to solve.

I agree. I do not break it now but discourage it, then discourage with warning and then break.

Honestly, while I do understand that you&#39;re trying to balance different sorts of breakage, it&#39;s a general assumption by people that statically exporting things, unless specifically noted otherwise, also provide their subroutines via direct access.

Basically, while I see your point that it isn&#39;t documented *to* work, my general expectation of CPAN code is that it *will* unless explicitly documented as not permitted, since that&#39;s how exporters &#40;especially Exporter using exporters&#41; normally work.

Now, if List::MoreUtils::all&#40;&#41; is going to change behaviour slightly in the name of sanity, having that happen might be reasonable - but causing it to cease existence is a huge violation of POLS and IMO a massive backcompat breakage in spirit even if the absence of explicit documentation either way means it isn&#39;t a backcompat breakage in letter.

I suspect this was the idea that people were trying to express to you but was somewhat obscured by their ... suboptimal tone due to having just experienced a very nasty surprise.

Which is the reason for the 0.400_004 hot fix. I fully agree to the assumption and way of work in general.

I think posting an RFC publically somewhere is probably a good way to invite comments, esp. if the post gets linked to #toolchain by somebody.

Admittedly, I&#39;ll probably still completely miss it until ether /msg&#39;s me a link, but given she almost certainly *will* I just have to try and be grateful enough for it that she keeps doing that.

There’re two reasonable places:

1&#41; RT Queue &#40;dedicated ticket or this ticket&#41;
2&#41; PerlMonks

Generally I do not intend spec LMU - it _is_ a small footprint package.
Some people who would agree being sounding board or a mailing list or alike would be helpful.

Make no mistake, LMU may be low footprint, but it is still very high profile: as of <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://ali.as/top100/">http://ali.as/top100/</a></span> it is around #10 in most-depended upon modules that is neither in the toolchain nor dual-lived :&#41;

I&#39;d volunteer as sounding board [and I assure you, I sound a bit friendlier when writing german ;&#41;] but I still think there should be a public discussion for significant changes, seeing how many people would be affected.

Feel free to email me directly.

I cannot stand the perlmonks UI and my mail setup is completely fucked in terms of being able to handle lists. Equally, enough other people may be able to respond on a list that my technical failings aren&#39;t an issue.

I sort of wonder if &#34;dump it into PTG and use github issues&#34; might not be a reasonable approach, since unlike RT we can have people who aren&#39;t co-maints auto-notified of new tickets, and LMU kinda feels like toolchain-level important to me.

Of course, if you want a direct sounding bored before doing other stuff, &#39;grab me on IRC&#39; is a good solution as always.
