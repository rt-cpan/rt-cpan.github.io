China Datacom Corp.
Sym: CDPN
Close: $0.065

CDPN announced Friday that is has acquired all outstanding shares of
General Link Information Systems, Chinas only GPS vehicle monitoring and
management system. GPS systems are huge; controlling that market is even
bigger. Read the news and get on CDPN first thing Monday!

Because the customer management is never queried for address data it
never becomes a bottleneck even as the system grows and the demands for
address data multiply.
So we need to make sure to have the right tools at hand &#40;for example,
see Visualizing Dependencies&#41; and to gain experience by making mistakes
early in a small scale. Once could say that OOPSLA has become the victim
of its own success because only a small portion of OOPLSA has still
something to do with object-oriented design.
One slide highlighted the relationships between many different kinds of
models, such as process models, interaction models, operational models
etc. Now how appropriate is that?
No compiler generators, byte code injection, or other magic were needed.
I am not sure whether it was this oft cited weakness or the realization
that interaction is stepping in the foreground, but UML 2.
I had a good start with Jim Newkirk taking me to the Addison-Wesley
author dinner, which I crashed. For me, this was Jerry Sussman&#39;s talk
with the illustrious title Why Programming is a Good Medium for
Expressing Poorly Understood and Sloppily Formulated Ideas. &#34; The panel
was dotted with memorable quotes from some of the more memorable names
in the history of software engineering: &#34;Software design is rarely the
subject of a lawsuit.
Here some of my take-aways.
Now that we are more interested in the interaction we turn the line &#40;i.
Once again the programming language syntax itself is debatable &#40;and has
been debated&#41; but that should not make us ignore some of the good ideas
that are part of the run-time environment.
I think Dragos&#39; Orchestration Patterns might give us some better
appreciation for these types of  features. OOPSLA is in even bigger
trouble as it has two O&#39;s.
This is what the CSI &#40;Connected Systems Initiative&#41; really is. Process
modeling and execution tools based on BPEL &#40;or comparable languages&#41;
also do pretty good in terms of making the run-time environment
available programmatically.
Both sender and receiver of messages have to agree on a common channel
name in order to exchange messages.
Because the customer management is never queried for address data it
never becomes a bottleneck even as the system grows and the demands for
address data multiply. Luckily the OOPSLA Wiki contains a transcript.
While it is easy to come up with something significantly better than
java.
Contract first development: A contract is not just a WSDL document, but
an abstract domain model.
If it sets a different value will that be persisted to the database? It
is a mess of bits and pieces with no unifying consistency. Explicit and
Implicit Concepts Another critical observation is that CalendarDate
actually denotes a date and not a specific point in time like java.
Additionally, loose coupling brings variability and lack of control.
ARC Symposium The symposium itself was based on a skid that covered
topics ranging from SOA to Agile to process and domain modeling. For
example, if the service provided an operation that can verify a credit
card supplied by a customer we might simply name the channel
VerifyCreditCard. I made it to Thursday&#39;s key note about 15 minutes
late. And I was able to squeeze in an article for ObjektSpektrum in
Germany. The Time and Money library does not hide these concepts but
instead makes them explicit. In fact, SmallTalk let you do this. This
observation also explains why UML Class Diagrams tend to be more popular
then Collaboration Diagrams.
First, not everything is an object and object modeling is not the best
choice for all problem domains.
According to Don, the acronym WTF was considered but was reserved for
the Windows Transaction Foundation.
Let&#39;s look at a few obvious choices: A very simple approach assigns each
component its own channel. In combination, though, it makes for an
inspiring mix of pragmatic information and intellectual stimulation.
IIS 7 was also demo&#39;d.
Structured design, introduced by Constantine and Yourdon some 25 years
ago was one of the early &#34;methodologies&#34; and also included a design
notation.
The fact is: bad code is not actually written but rather happens. How a
receiver responds to this event is completely hidden to the sender. For
example, a component that deals with credit card validations could be
called the CreditService and react to messages sent on a channel also
named CreditService. Most of the discussion centered on the role of
design techniques and modeling languages and the way we design software.
Unfortunately, my paper notes are in the office so I&#39;ll have to write
about it in more detail later.
Some of the classic design patterns presented in GOF do concern
themselves with the way objects interact.
Note that because the concept of time zone is critical for this
conversion there is no default constructor.
Furthermore, some time in the not too distant future we will see a
transactional file system that allows multiple file creation and writes
in a single commit. He was referring to the usual diagram that depicts
each component as a box and each interaction as a line between two
boxes. And reliable sources also tell me that we might be seeing
integration patterns focused on conversations soon. Can it assume that
they would also be zero?
