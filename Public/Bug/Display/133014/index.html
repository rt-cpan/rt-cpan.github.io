Major Gifts Ramp-Up Is a Live Online Financial Capacity-Building That Will Challenge Everything You Believe About The Raising of Money During COVID-19.

&#40;Video-Conference With Your Colleagues to Learn How To Raise Major Gifts Using Virtual Technology&#41;

Dear Nonprofit Execs &#38; Colleagues in Service,

We know that you have been monitoring the health issues our Nation face as America reopens. THAT&#39;S WHY ALL MAJOR GIFTS RAMP-UP EVENTS WILL BE OFFERED LIVE AND ONLINE. Join your colleagues and interact in our new online conference environment. You&#39;ll be able to interact via VIDEO CONFERENCE with both us and your fellow attendees. 

Calamities and major downturns in the economy occur every decade. While COVID-19 is unique, what&#39;s not unique is how to make it through a crisis. In order for your charity to navigate these unprecedented times and be stronger in the future join us for Major Gifts Ramp-Up. As it turns out Major Gifts Fundraising is more important than ever and will be the single greatest revenue generator your organization can rely on during uncertain times. We&#39;ve raised millions over the last ninety days for charities across the spectrum.

&#34;Major Gifts Ramp-Up Saved our Nonprofit from COVID-19. We&#39;ve been privileged to turn down PPP &#38; EIDL so other nonprofits could access the funds they need to make it through the pandemic.&#34; ~ Brent Bohanan, Habitat for Humanity

Simply put, money is oxygen. Without it you can&#39;t breathe. Is your organization on life support? Are you receiving the air you need to survive the social and economic crisis we&#39;re now facing? If you&#39;re a nonprofit executive board member, development officer, pastor, volunteer or marketing director it&#39;s time for you to RE-IMAGINE PHILANTHROPY in ways that transform both you and your important mission.

If you&#39;re ready to flourish before, during and after COVID-19 Major Gifts Ramp-Up is the answer. Learn how to use your existing staff and resources to grow your organization by simply changing the way you function each day. Go from business as usual to fully funded revenues streams that will not only raise money for your immediate needs, but will install a permanent culture of philanthropy within your nonprofit. Here’s what needs to be in place.

1. At least six months operating cash reserves. 
2. An unrestricted endowment comprised of at least $500,000. 
3. Ongoing, deep relationships with at least 100 major donors. 
4. An agile Board made up of only five to seven experts. 
5. A robust Case for Support that describes a heroic mission of scale to impact your community. 
6. A five year plan for growing impact and revenue.

VISIT HERE or press &#34;Get Started&#34; Below

Following the Great Recession of 2008, the founders of NANOE conducted a study of 485 nonprofits that received capacity building grants during the recession. Only 15% of these organization were able to leverage that funding to grow their impact and revenue.

When we studied those 15% who were successful, we learned the following:

1. They built more capacity over a five year period than those nonprofits who indicated they stagnated or declined during the same time period.
2. They grew budget, programs &#38; donors, despite the recession.
3. They grew their nonprofits regardless of the size/involvement of their board.
4. They externalized their mission for the purpose of fundraising.
5. They developed board members who evaluated the chief executive and promoted the goals and values of the CEO.

What was the common factor in the success of these nonprofits? A strong CEO or Executive Director who planned for the future and viewed fundraising as a top priority.  Strong leaders understand that philanthropy is essential for your nonprofit’s success and that 80% of philanthropy in the U.S. is from individuals and families.

Don’t let anyone tell you now is not the time to fund raise.  Don’t let anyone tell you things have to stay the same.  Don’t let a few panicked Board members hijack your nonprofit’s future. The future of your organization will be determined by your strong staff leadership &#40;not by your Board or political leaders&#41;. Now is the time to act!

Major Gifts Ramp-Up Live is not nonprofit management 101! Meet the fundraising veterans who&#39;ve raised millions. Join us to learn how you can build the financial capacity you need to secure your future. This virtual event will challenge everything you believe about the raising of money, and will make five, six and seven figure major gifts available to your nonprofit in the shortest period of time possible.

Over 17,000 nonprofit executives from across the U.S. have already attended. THEY LOVE THESE EVENTS &#40;and so do their boards!&#41; Why? Because this fast-paced and provocative training have been customized for the audience in attendance. Prepare to hear the truth in ways you&#39;ve never experienced before. You&#39;ll learn from the masters who defied convention and challenged the false thinking that keeps charities broke.

“I’ve spent the last week receiving email messages, phone calls and personal visits thanking me for bringing Major Gifts Ramp-Up to our community. This spectacular 2-day capacity-building conference was daring, confrontational and exactly what our organizations needed in the way of training.  Conventional methods of management and fundraising were challenged with humor and insight. Their expert faculty engaged our grantees and inspired them to grow revenues in new ways that work.  Prepare for significant change if you give yourself this gift.” ~ Pamela Ballard, Community Service Council 

Who should attend? If you’re a CEO, CFO, COO, CDO, Executive Director, Development Director, Staff Member, Board Member, Pastor, Trustee or Volunteer responsible for the financial health of a nonprofit, ministry or church then you&#39;ll want to make sure you bring as many people as possible to this training.

Tuition for a quality capacity-building conference could cost up to $700 per guest. We&#39;re thrilled to share that a group of major donors have underwritten this event allowing us to offer tuition for ONE PERSON at $148 or UNLIMITED REGISTRATIONS for only $298.

That&#39;s right, every member of your team can come for only $298. Please register today. This event will reach capacity soon.

Are these scary times? Yes.  Does the future seem uncertain? Yes. But we know from history that organizations who use difficult times as opportunities for change emerge on the other side resilient, stronger, and ahead of their competitors.  Major Gifts Ramp-Up will give you the tools you need to adapt, change and grow your nonprofit.

We believe in you. We know that there are funds available to ensure your sustainability. Let us show you how to access them ASAP. I look forward to meeting you personally. Until then I remain,

Sincerely Yours,
Stefanie Stark, CNC

NDI Faculty
