<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Currently in your code you try to recognize whether we&#39;re running 
Cygwin by trying to run uname. Sadly this has the side effect of also 
simple checking whether Cygwin is *installed*.

This means when trying to install on ActivePerl with Cygwin also 
installed the Makefile.PL gets into an improperly defined state and 
ignores the %Config settings for which make to use.

Since you do not have a contribution policy defined in your 
documentation &#40;please add one&#41;, I&#39;ve chosen to make the patch available 
to you in this form:

I&#39;ve uploaded a repo with the history of this module to github and

You can pull from my repo via this url: git://github.com/wchristian/
pogl.git

As an additional note: I cannot help much with the C side of things, 
but i&#39;d happily contribute by working my way through the perl files in 
the distribution, refactoring, cleaning and tightening code whereever 
possible in order to move towards a more modern Perl. If you have 
interest in me doing this, please let me know how you would prefer to 
receive my contributions. &#40;My preferred method, excluding direct

Right.  The current OpenGL configuration
is build time only and pretty crufty as
well.  I have plans to refactor the module
for portability and runtime OpenGL support.
I hope to get to that this Spring.

One thing that would help would be simply to add to
the TODO list with things you come up with and how
or where they might be implemented.

The biggest challenge I see is that the basic
OpenGL bindings are very crude.  I&#39;ve cleaned
up the build process with the existing code
so it now builds on most perl platforms.

There is still work to do but *real* progress
needs to be in restructuring the build and
binding process.  Here is an outline of the
current plans:

&#40;1&#41; Switch from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build
    to take problems with shell and make program versions
    out of the configure process for portability.
    Module::Build configuration only needs perl and C.

&#40;2&#41; Move OpenGL library detection from the OpenGL
    configure/build process into an Alien module
    like Alien::OpenGL.

&#40;3&#41; Switch from rolling our own perl&lt;-&gt;OpenGL
    binding to one based on the GLEW library
    in something like Alien::OpenGL::GLEW.

    Using GLEW means that we automatically can
    support bindings for OpenGL versions up to 4.2
    &#40;currently&#41;, the bindings are the same for
    all perl platforms, using GLEW as the base
    means we can autogenerate the XS from the
    GLEW source which should make things much
    more maintainable.

&#40;4&#41; Add &#34;friendly&#34; perl-ish bindings for the
    many OpenGL API calls like glColorXX so
    a single glColor&#40;&#41; would transparently
    call the appropriate glColorXX&#40;&#41; at the
    C level.

&#40;5&#41; Add bindings to GLUI to the OpenGL module
    to allow more sophisticated GUIs to be
    developed using OpenGL+GLUT+GLUI as a
    *very* portable option to perl/Tk and
    others.

    There are a number of GUI widget sets
    out there for perl but the last time
    I checked they all did not work on one
    perl platform or another &#40;e.g., win32,
    mac os x, linux, solaris, *BDS,...&#41;.  A
    simple GUI environment based on OpenGL
    could provide a basic, completely
    portable GUI.

I&#39;ve figured out how all of this can be done
but have been busy working on some Perl Data
Language releases &#40;trying to get it building
out-of-the-box on win32 platforms&#41;.

I would welcome your thoughts on all this
and would be happy to add your patch if you
could provide it against the official git
above.

Cheers,
Chris

Gonna read the rest of your mail in a bit, but wanted to answer this 
first so i don&#39;t keep you waiting. My github copy is a direct fork of 
yours and has all your history, so you can just do this:

git remote add wchristian git://github.com/wchristian/pogl.git
git fetch --all
git merge wchristian/wchristian

&#40; This kinda stuff is what git is there for. ;&#41; &#41;

That&#39;s what i meant when i said refactoring. The current Makefile.PL is 
really, really ugly and i can&#39;t imagine what kind of weird behaviors it 
has hidden; so i would first like to completely refactor it so it 
actually gets somewhat readable, then do the same to whatever actual 
Perl floats around in this distribution.

As i mentioned in my previous email, that&#39;s where i forked my repo 
from. :&#41;

I find patches to be cumbersome to work with, since windows doesn&#39;t 
exactly come with tools to handle them gracefully. However since git 
allows you to add any remote url you want as an additional source for 
the repo to pull branches from, i can simply have mine and yours in my 
repo and pull down from yours to update mine and conversely you can 
pull data from mine as if it was a simple branch in your repo. &#40;Going 
completely via github would have the added benefit that you could 
review pull requests in the browser in a very convenient view.&#41;

There&#39;s one thing i might have to check later, which relates to a now-
abandoned project of mine in which i added support for a few functions 
regarding occlusion culling that were missing in earlier versions of 
this module.

Right now however i&#39;m not actually doing anything with OpenGL and am 
only planning to play around with it for the purposes of demo making. 
If anything comes up i&#39;ll be sure to pipe up. :&#41;

</div>
That is a neat idea. I could make an OpenGL::Helper module in basic 
Perl that combines such calls in order to hash out the API, and someone 
with the needed C chops &#40;you?&#41; could then convert that to XS once 
they&#39;re happy with it.

</div>
I&#39;m afraid that on the other things i cannot provide much useful input. 
I&#39;ve never actually looked at the differences between 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker &#40;though i did provide windows patches for it&#41; and 
Module::Build, nor am i familiar with build exercises in particular. In 
the same vein, i have absolutely zero experience with all the libraries 
you mentioned &#40;i am in fact still very much a beginner in OpenGL&#41; or C, 
so i wouldn&#39;t know what binding them in entails.

The main motivation for me really is that i&#39;m pretty good with Perl, 
wanted to see if i can do something demoish with this, found out it 
wouldn&#39;t install, fixed that and in the process saw lots of disgusting 
things in Makefile.PL that i&#39;d like to clean up. :&#41;

Additionally i&#39;m very much a windows developer and have multiple 
machines with multiple perl configurations, and thus would like to 
offer my experience with Windows and Perl in order to help improve this 
module in regards to compatibility and quality.

Testing new releases &#40;do you submit CPAN Testers
reports?&#41; is a huge help---especially for multiple
win32 environments.  The current build/Makefile.PL
could stand some fixes for specific bugs but more
than that should wait until the bindings themselves
are refactored to use GLEW and Alien::OpenGL.

Definitely submit any problems you find and/or
fix as I&#39;d like this code base as robust as
possible &#40;given its flaws&#41; until the new
approach can come on line.  In light of this
discussion, I think I&#39;ll stand up an official
Perl OpenGL project at some git host site so
that these discussions and thoughts can
continue in an open framework.

Thinking loud here: Doesn&#39;t OpenGL have abilities to dump the current image buffer? If so one could possibly put together a set of reference renderings that the test scripts could then generate and compare against? On the other hand: These are only bindings to another library. I&#39;m not too sure whether it makes sense to test that that library works, vs. just making sure that the bindings don&#39;t explode when called.

OpenGL is specified so that you can reproduce the
output so tests like this should be possible.
Ideally, the tests could verify the correct
operation of the OpenGL API via the perl binding.

In practice, I would just like enough to verify
not only that things compile but also that they
run.

I&#39;ll take a look at perl.reddit.com &#40;never heard of it&#41;.

My biggest obstacle with perl modules is when they
have dependencies built around unix or posix.  Since
windows doesn&#39;t have good support there and doesn&#39;t
have a package distribution framework, the most
difficult part is building the external libraries
for windows *before* you can even deal with the
perl issues.  PDL, in particular, uses many libraries
to provide additional graphics and computation which
are not readily available on win32/x86/x86_64 systems.

An update: I was able to checkout your branch
from the information below but when I took a
look at the diff between the proposed and original
Makefile.PL, there were many lines of changes.
They appear to be the result of reformatting the
Makefile.PL but it will be a while before I have
the time to work through the changes to verify
before merging.

If you had a way that I could apply the same
reformatting to my Makefile.PL copy &#40;perltidy
and settings?&#41; then the process would go much
faster.

Thanks,
