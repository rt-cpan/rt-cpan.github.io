<div class="messagebody">
<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Hi,

I found a small problem with the scripts crosstable and pairingtable,
not working if there were empty directories for future rounds.

Note: I&#39;ve read your mail about crosstable and pairingtable being like
proofs of concept. But they are very useful, so I decided to write
this mail nevertheless. I&#39;ve found no other way to contact you than
submitting a new bug. Perhaps the problem I discoverd is not even a
bug. In that case please close this bug report as soon as possible.

I&#39;ll describy shortly were the problem occurs: To use your module for
managing a tournament I would like to create the directory structure
first &#40;that is, creating empty subdirectories for single rounds,
creating empty scores subdirectory and creating empty file
league.yaml&#41;. Afterwards &#40;as the tournament goes on&#41; those directories
and files could be filled with content step by step.

The problem arises when trying to create a crosstable after let&#39;s say
the first round. There are data files in subdirectory &#34;1/&#34; and there
is the file &#34;scores/1.yaml&#34;. Subdirectories &#34;2/&#34;, &#34;3/&#34; etc. are still
empty.

Somehow crosstable doesn&#39;t recognize it should omit rounds 2, 3 etc.
Instead it fails, complaining about being unable to open
./2/tourney.yaml.

The reason seems to be line 57/58 in crosstable:

  55 for my $file &#40; glob &#40;&#39;./*&#39;&#41; &#41;
  56 {
  57     push @rounds, $1 if -d $file and $file =~ m/\/&#40;\d+&#41;$/ and
  58           glob&#40; &#34;./$file/* &#34; &#41;;
  59 }

The last test 

  glob&#40; &#34;./$file/* &#34;&#41;

doesn&#39;t seem to recognize that directory 2 &#40;and others&#41; are empty. I&#39;m
not sure about this, but maybe it returns &#34;true&#34; in the context 
given -- even though there aren&#39;t any files matched?

However, in my opinion a smarter test would be

  -e &#34;./scores/$1.yaml&#34;

which tests whether there are already results for the given round. The
relevant section of crosstable would read like:

  55 for my $file &#40; glob &#40;&#39;./*&#39;&#41; &#41;
  56 {
  57     push @rounds, $1 if -d $file and $file =~ m/\/&#40;\d+&#41;$/ and 
  58          -e &#34;./scores/$1.yaml&#34;;
  59 }

The same applies to pairingtable &#40;line 54/55 there&#41;.

What do you think -- would it be sensible to change the relevant
lines?

Actually I would prefer to go a step further and implement an option
to pass crosstable and pairingtable a round number as an argument. The
scripts then compute those tables for that round. If no round number
is passed as an argument, the last round with results &#40;taken from the
&#34;scores&#34; subdirectory&#41; should be assumed.

Of course I can do that locally, but maybe it&#39;s useful for others as
well.

Best regards

Christian

I&#39;d like to keep this conversation public, because I think it
might be useful to others. If there is something that you feel
you can&#39;t talk about publicly, I guess we could do something,
but I don&#39;t think there is anything like that at the moment.
There is not enough interest from others to justify a mailing
list. 

I think this problem is a good reason for a bug report.

Why do you want to do it that way, rather than as you go? Though
I guess there is no reason not to try and make this possible.

I think my reasoning for doing it this way was that it was very
clear how many rounds had been played. If no subdirectories
existed, there couldn&#39;t be any more rounds.

If you make it possible to run the script in a less clear
situation, for example with incomplete score files,
half-filled-out before the round has been played, or old
serialization files, in a &#39;replay&#39; of the tournament, it&#39;s more
likely to fail.

&gt; is passed as an argument, the last round with results &#40;taken from the
&gt; &#34;scores&#34; subdirectory&#41; should be assumed.
</div>
If we are going to go that route, it might be better to require
the round. I guess I didn&#39;t want to do that because I didn&#39;t want
to have to remember the round!

Actually something I have wanted more than this is the ability to
run the scripts either in the tournament directory or the round
subdirectory.

Do you think most people would prefer to prepare their round
subdirectories first? I doubt there is anyone else using the
modules.

All that said, if you submit a patch with this change, prepared
like with &#39;diff -u pairingtable.orig pairingtable&#39;, I&#39;ll apply
it.

<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; Note: I&#39;ve read your mail about crosstable and pairingtable being like
&gt; &gt; proofs of concept. But they are very useful, so I decided to write
&gt; &gt; this mail nevertheless. I&#39;ve found no other way to contact you than
&gt; &gt; submitting a new bug. Perhaps the problem I discoverd is not even a
&gt; &gt; bug. In that case please close this bug report as soon as possible.
</div>&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;d like to keep this conversation public, because I think it
&gt; might be useful to others. If there is something that you feel
&gt; you can&#39;t talk about publicly, I guess we could do something,
&gt; but I don&#39;t think there is anything like that at the moment.
&gt; There is not enough interest from others to justify a mailing
&gt; list. 
</div>
It&#39;s fine for me as it is. I just wanted to be sure I choosed the
right way to ask questions or make suggestions about your module.

<span
    class="message-stanza-folder closed"
    onclick="fold_message_stanza(this, 'Show\x20quoted\x20text', 'Hide\x20quoted\x20text');">Show quoted text</span><br /><div class="message-stanza closed"><div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll describy shortly were the problem occurs: To use your module for
&gt; &gt; managing a tournament I would like to create the directory structure
&gt; &gt; first &#40;that is, creating empty subdirectories for single rounds,
&gt; &gt; creating empty scores subdirectory and creating empty file
&gt; &gt; league.yaml&#41;. Afterwards &#40;as the tournament goes on&#41; those directories
&gt; &gt; and files could be filled with content step by step.
</div>&gt; 
&gt; Why do you want to do it that way, rather than as you go? Though
&gt; I guess there is no reason not to try and make this possible.
</div>
Well, actually I see no convincing reason to prefer the order
described in my last post. But anyway, I think an existing empty
subdirectory shouldn&#39;t stop the script to work properly. But see
below about the question how the correct round number could be
detected by the script.

<span
    class="message-stanza-folder closed"
    onclick="fold_message_stanza(this, 'Show\x20quoted\x20text', 'Hide\x20quoted\x20text');">Show quoted text</span><br /><div class="message-stanza closed"><div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; The problem arises when trying to create a crosstable after let&#39;s say
&gt; &gt; the first round. There are data files in subdirectory &#34;1/&#34; and there
&gt; &gt; is the file &#34;scores/1.yaml&#34;. Subdirectories &#34;2/&#34;, &#34;3/&#34; etc. are still
&gt; &gt; empty.
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; Somehow crosstable doesn&#39;t recognize it should omit rounds 2, 3 etc.
&gt; &gt; Instead it fails, complaining about being unable to open
&gt; &gt; ./2/tourney.yaml.
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; The reason seems to be line 57/58 in crosstable:
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt;   55 for my $file &#40; glob &#40;&#39;./*&#39;&#41; &#41;
&gt; &gt;   56 {
&gt; &gt;   57     push @rounds, $1 if -d $file and $file =~ m/\/&#40;\d+&#41;$/ and
&gt; &gt;   58           glob&#40; &#34;./$file/* &#34; &#41;;
&gt; &gt;   59 }
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; The last test 
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt;   glob&#40; &#34;./$file/* &#34;&#41;
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem to recognize that directory 2 &#40;and others&#41; are empty. I&#39;m
&gt; &gt; not sure about this, but maybe it returns &#34;true&#34; in the context 
&gt; &gt; given -- even though there aren&#39;t any files matched?
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; However, in my opinion a smarter test would be
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt;   -e &#34;./scores/$1.yaml&#34;
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; which tests whether there are already results for the given round. The
&gt; &gt; relevant section of crosstable would read like:
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt;   55 for my $file &#40; glob &#40;&#39;./*&#39;&#41; &#41;
&gt; &gt;   56 {
&gt; &gt;   57     push @rounds, $1 if -d $file and $file =~ m/\/&#40;\d+&#41;$/ and 
&gt; &gt;   58          -e &#34;./scores/$1.yaml&#34;;
&gt; &gt;   59 }
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; The same applies to pairingtable &#40;line 54/55 there&#41;.
</div>&gt; 
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; What do you think -- would it be sensible to change the relevant
&gt; &gt; lines?
</div>&gt; 
&gt; I think my reasoning for doing it this way was that it was very
&gt; clear how many rounds had been played. If no subdirectories
&gt; existed, there couldn&#39;t be any more rounds.
</div>
Okay, point taken. I thought the test 

  glob&#40; &#34;./$file/* &#34;&#41;

was designed to ignore empty subdirectory? But propably I didn&#39;t get
that right.

But what about the situation when the pairings for a new round were
generated &#40;files in subdirectory $round/&#41; but there aren&#39;t any results
yet &#40;no file $round.yaml in scores&#41;? I would argue that running
crosstable should generate the crosstable before that round.

&gt; situation, for example with incomplete score files,
&gt; half-filled-out before the round has been played, or old
&gt; serialization files, in a &#39;replay&#39; of the tournament, it&#39;s more
&gt; likely to fail.
</div>
I see, though I wonder if relying on the round subdirectories isn&#39;t a
bit fault-prone itself.

&gt; &gt; is passed as an argument, the last round with results &#40;taken from the
&gt; &gt; &#34;scores&#34; subdirectory&#41; should be assumed.
</div>&gt; 
&gt; If we are going to go that route, it might be better to require
&gt; the round. I guess I didn&#39;t want to do that because I didn&#39;t want
&gt; to have to remember the round!
</div>
The reason for my suggestion was, that I thought, &#34;crosstable&#34; and
&#34;pairingtable&#34; could be used in two modes. One mode &#40;the &#34;main mode&#34;&#41;
would be used for actual tournament management -- in that case always
the current crosstable or pairingtable should be computed and no round
number is required. But in a second mode &#40;maybe &#34;replay mode&#34;&#41; the
scripts could be able to compute crosstables or pairingtables for past
rounds -- dependent on the round number given.

&gt; run the scripts either in the tournament directory or the round
&gt; subdirectory.
</div>
Probably very crude, but couldn&#39;t one add a line like

  chdir&#40;&#39;..&#39;&#41; if &#40;&#40;! -d &#39;./scores&#39;&#41; and &#40;-e &#39;../league.yaml&#39;&#41;&#41;;

at the beginning of the scripts?

</div>
No I wouldn&#39;t count on that. It&#39;s just the way I went for my web
frontend. [At the moment it&#39;s really very simple but it&#39;s running fine
locally. I still have to clean the code and to move it to a web
server. Furthermore it&#39;s still in German.] But for that application I
can tweak your scripts as I need. Basically what it does is:

* There is one CGI script which serves to set up tournaments, to
  choose an existing tournament and to delete tournaments. While
  setting up a tournament one has to specify the number of rounds and
  after that all subdirectories are created as described.

* There is a second CGI script which allows managing a single
  tournament. One can view, add and delete participants, create new
  pairings, fill in results, view old results and view crosstables for
  a given round. And of course one can return to the first script &#40;for
  instance to switch tournaments&#41;.

</div>
Well, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s really an improvement. But nevertheless I
attach the patches generated by

  diff -u crosstable.orig crosstable &gt; patch.crosstable.0.06

and 

  diff -u pairingtable.orig pairingtable &gt; patch.pairingtable.0.06

It&#39;s fine if you ignore them ;-&#41;

with version 0.08 I can pass &#39;crosstable&#39; and &#39;pairingtable&#39; the round

hey -- it works.

If you are curious and would like to have a look, I can give you
access to my test installation and send you the scripts. But I would

access data here.

The web site is very nice. For an arbiter it would be the most
convenient way to work. 

I found it quite easy to enter many entrants. Perhaps that was
because of the browser I was using.

When you have time, I encourage you to take out the call to pair
and access the Games::Tournament::Swiss modules themselves.

It must be slower invoking perl twice.

Solving problems you have doing this will improve the modules.

And perhaps you don&#39;t want to use YAML. There is no YAML in the
modules themselves, only in the scripts.

Maybe you are right and it works convinient as it is. 

But I have to add some code to prevent that the list of players
couldn&#39;t be changed &#40;perhaps accidentally&#41; once the tournament is
started. An exception would be to remove a player from the tournament.

&gt; 
&gt; It must be slower invoking perl twice.
&gt; 
&gt; Solving problems you have doing this will improve the modules.
</div>
I&#39;ll definitely try to do that. But it may take some time.

&gt; modules themselves, only in the scripts.
</div>
Yes, I&#39;ll think about that. I noticed that you are reducing 
reliance on the YAML serialization files &#40;as is noted in your README
file&#41;.

But on the other hand I would like to keep my web frontend compatible
with the scripts you distribute with Games::Tournament::Swiss. So I
won&#39;t invent something completely different from your approach.

Actually that might be better because it would give the modules
more of a work-out.

The only reason for compatibility would be when importing and
exporting data.

Then a standard format that other software &#40;and people&#41; could use
would be the best.

But that&#39;s a topic for a later time, so I&#39;m going to close this
bug report.

this is just a note regarding our earlier discussion.

I finally came back to my scripts and managed to do just that. The
scripts are now working fine without calling &#39;pair&#39;, &#39;crosstable&#39; or
&#39;pairingtable&#39; -- though I took some code and a lot of ideas from
those scripts &#40;and from t/three.t as well&#41;.

If I continue working on the relevant parts of my scripts I might
find some problems with the modules -- in that case I will report
them.

</div>
I did that as well. Now I use a simple text format for storing
pairings and results.

Thanks for your advice and best regards

Christian

P.S. The URL of my scripts didn&#39;t change. In case you &#40;or someone
else&#41; is interested, I can &#40;re-&#41;send the access data to my test
installation or the scripts.
