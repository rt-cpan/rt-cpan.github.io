Charitable Executives, both your personal and professional leadership has brought you to a point in your career that qualifies you to join us next year in Charleston, SC for NANOE&#39;s Board of Governors&#39; Convention &#38; Expo.. You&#39;re a part of a wide-array of industry professionals from all stations within the public, private and charitable sectors. Vendors, CEOs, staff members, administrators, donors, board members and clergy who work or volunteer in the human welfare, education, healthcare, arts, animals, environmental and/or public benefit sectors have been invited.

DAY 1 - MARCH 26, 2019
KEYNOTE ADDRESSES

Kathleen Robinson | System Shock: New Era Leadership Structures
CLEMSON UNIVERSITY &#40;RETIRED&#41;
Dr. Kathleen Robinson, world-renowned thought-leader and author of New Guidelines for Tomorrowâs Nonprofit, will demonstrate why charities have based their governance models on principles thatâve never worked and never will. Kathy will inspire NANOE Governors to transform their organizational structures to gain the competitive advantage they need to solve our worldâs biggest challenges.

Jimmy LaRose | Overcoming the House of Org
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE
Jimmy LaRose, Author, Speaker and Nonprofit Provocateur, will teach NANOE Governors how to stop their local United Ways, AFP Chapters &#38; Community Foundations from keeping them poor. Jimmy will reveal the secret to going over, under, around and through the walls of these failing institutions to get the millions of dollars that really belong to you

Gail Giarratano | The Existential Capacity-Builder
ANCHOR SHRED &#38; RECYCLE COMPANY
Gail Giarratano, Award Winning Nonprofit CEO and Ted Talker, will explore the fundamental role âcaringâ plays in driving charities to scale. Gail regards all people and the environment as created and loved by God and will prove that way we treat each other and the earth is the key to eradicating all the problems NANOE Governors have been tasked with solving.

Cathy Parker | Northern Lights: The Motion Picture
CINEVANTAGE PRODUCTIONS
Cathy Parker, also known around the world as the âAccidental Fundraiserâ, will share her epic tale of raising millions &#40;in only twelve short months&#41; to build a football field above the Arctic Circle for the youth of Barrow Alaska. Her story is the basis for the major motion picture âNorthern Lightsâ now in production and directed by Andy Tenant &#40;Sweet Home Alabama, Hitch, Anna &#38; The King, Ever After&#41; and produced by Honnie Korngold &#40;CineVantage.&#41;

Louis Fawcett | Disrupt or Be Disrupted
NANOE PRESIDENT
Louis Fawcett, NANOE President, will reveal why charity has been paralyzed by a set of failed âbest practicesâ and âethical codesâ that turned the Non-Profit Sector into a Non-Growth Sector decades ago. Louis will inspire NANOE Governors to abandon these current systems and replace them with a new set of enterprise models that inspire heroic missions of scale.

Anthony Charles | Musical Artist &#38; Social Activist
BLUES FROM THE KINO BORDER
Anthony Charles was born in New York City and started fronting bands in the 60&#39;s garage rock era. Anthonyâs musical stylings are a cross between Thelonious Monk, The Beatles, The Stones, Otis Redding, Paul Butterfield, Schoenberg and Bach. He is the lead vocalist for Anthony Charles and The Blues Dolphins a Chicago style Blues Quartet. Please press the âPlay Buttonâ above to hear High-Water Stomp just one of the many social impact songs heâll be performing at NANOEâs Convention &#38; Expo.

DAY 2 - MARCH 27, 2019

Track 1 - Boosting Capacity | New Guidelines for Nonprofits

KATHLEEN ROBINSON, PH.D., CNE, CDE, CNC
This full day executive track will be led by Kathleen Robinson and several guest speakers. The session will explore and discuss the key concepts found in the second edition of the NEW GUIDELINES FOR TOMORROWâS NONPROFIT - SECOND EDITION. Case examples will be given throughout the dayâs discussion. There will be plenty of time for discussion, as well as short input sessions around each of the following topics:

Give &#38; Take: Harnessing the Power of Differentiated Relationships
How can I turn my organization into a networked organization that engages in reciprocal relationships? Why is it important to do so?

Strong CEOs: Heroism, Strength, Knowledge, Achievement, Vision
What character and competence do effective CEOs display? What do we know about CEOs that have achieved major social and environmental impacts?

System Shock: New Era Management Structures for Charities that Soar
What are my responsibilities as a CEO to create an effectively lead and managed organization and operation? What kinds of organization and operations tend to be characteristic of those that grow and make an impact? What roles and responsibilities characterize board-CEO that promote growth and significant impact?

Building Capacity: Securing Financial Capital for Significant Impact
How can I generate revenues to a&#41; add, repair and increase technology, b&#41; secure money for equipment and facilities, c&#41; sustain and grow revenues to support current operations and make modest expansions, and d&#41; generate revenue for longer-term sustainability?

Boosting Capacity: Securing Change Capital for Significant Impact
How can we generate big dollar investments so that we can grow to scale, make a greater impact, seize opportunities, handle costs associated with taking risks during change periods, and make major changes when our customs or the surrounding social, economic or political context changes?

Evaluating Impact: Before, During, After Strategic Growth Actions
Want to generate revenue that is significant? How can we start an evaluation program if our organization is small? Why is having an evaluation program so significant to growth and to securing big dollar gifts? What kinds of evaluations make a difference?

An assignment of this gravity will require contributions from a wide-array of industry professionals from all stations within the public, private and charitable sectors. Vendors, CEOs, staff members, donors, board members and clergy who work or volunteer in the human welfare, education, healthcare, ministry, arts, animals and/or environmental sectors will be participating in this important work.

Track 2 - Building Capacity | Major Gifts Ramp-Up

JAMES P. LAROSE, CNE, CDE, CNC
If it&#39;s time for your nonprofit to receive immediate funding then join Jimmy LaRose for Major Gifts Ramp-Up. Over 14,500 nonprofit executives from across Europe and the United States have already attended. THEY LOVE THESE TRAININGS &#40;and so do their boards!&#41; Why? Because each of these fast-paced and provocative sessions demonstrate how big dollars can be secured in the shortest time possible. Prepare to hear the truth in ways you&#39;ve never experienced before. You&#39;ll learn from the master who defied convention and challenged the false thinking that keeps charities broke.

Re-Imagining Philanthropy
There are no rules here! Weâre trying to accomplish something

Major Gifts Ramp-Up Capacity-Building
Donors are more important than clients, causes or people

Case for Support...It&#39;s the Only Thing That Matters
Money chases after great dreams and sound plans

Institutional Case vs. Project Case
Itâs less about who you areâ¦itâs more aboutâ¦what youâre going to do

The Three Part Askâ¦Receiving Three Gifts At Once
Annual Fund, Capital Projects &#38; Endowment

The Real Reason Donors Give
Donor Motivation Matrix &#40;LaRose&#41; vs. Reasons Donors Give &#40;Panas&#41;

Consider the old adage, âthere are things in life that are more important than moneyâ, is about as silly as saying âthere are things in life that are more important than AIR.â Money, like air, in and of itself is not very impressive, nor does it give life meaning. However, life has very little meaningâ¦IF YOU CANâT BREATHE. Money is oxygen. Without it, charities asphyxiate, atrophy and fail.

NANOE&#39;s unparalleled commitment to building sustainable financial capacity has inspired &#34;MONEY IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING&#34; as the event theme for their biennial Board of Governors Convention &#38; Expo in Charleston, SC on March 26-27, 2019. NANOE Governors will be treated to five provocative keynote addresses performed by internationally renowned speakers who have taken charity to scale.

We look forward to seeing you there. Until then I remain,

Sincerely Yours,

Tracy Ebarb, CFRE

NANOE National Director
