<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">This implements the following:

* Changed the behavior of the _event_handle sub to completely process
all of the receive buffers &#40;using instant/zero-second select calls&#41;
before continuing back to sending requests.
* Adds some extra debugging statements for timings

Okay, now we are starting to get into deeper changes into Dispatcher. 
However, this is a small set of changes with a huge impact to large
requests.  This makes sense, since it&#39;s just processing what is already
in its queue.  If the dispatcher is stuck continuing to process receive
packets, then it has no business sending new requests, anyway.

The current process flows like this:

S = Send request, R = Receive packet
SRSRSRSRSRSR....

The new one is &#40;approx.&#41;:
SRSRSRRSRRSRSRSRRRSRSR...

In most cases, the new method is not going to be processing that many
receive packets, since it&#39;s keeping up with traffic.  Generally just 1-3
packets per cycle.  However, with the old method, if the buffer is
starting to build, it will continue to build until hosts timeout, or
worse, the OS starts to drop the packets.

A second argument is that this behavior already exists for TCP
connections.  Look here:

for &#40;keys %{$this-&gt;{_descriptors}}&#41; {
   if &#40;vec $rout, $_, 1&#41; {
      DEBUG_INFO&#40;&#39;descriptor [%d] ready for read&#39;, $_&#41;;
      $this-&gt;_callback_execute&#40;@{$this-&gt;{_descriptors}-&gt;{$_}}[0,1]&#41;;
   }
}

This is from the current code.  You&#39;ve got a loop around EACH descriptor
that has data and the Dispatcher is already processing the callback for
EACH one before it ends the loop and goes back to sending.  Problem is
that poor ol&#39; UDP is stuck with using the same fileno, per Transport.pm
rules.  &#40;It&#39;ll keep getting &#34;reused {type} socket&#34; debug messages for
every session opened.&#41;  In most cases, you&#39;ll end up with every host and
every request all using the same fileno.

So, really, this is a bug fix to make UDP behave more like TCP in the
event loop.  And if it makes the Dispatcher more efficient at TCP, then
so be it; that&#39;s a bonus.

+ =head2 Multiple Non-blocking Objects for Multiple Hosts
+ 
+ Multiple non-blocking sessions can be created to query multiple hosts at the
+ same time.  Each object is different and can have different options, but they
+ are all tied to the same dispatcher.  This means that the dispatcher will
+ process all requests from all hosts when the event loop is started, and won&#39;t
+ return until everything has replied or timed out.
+ 
+ Prior to v6.10, Net::SNMP would send requests as fast as possible, even if the
+ transport buffers could not handle the amount of data returning back.  This was
+ especially true when communicating with multiple hosts on the traditional UDP
+ port.  Data was checked and processed as requests were being sent, but only one
+ packet at a time.
+ 
+ With the improved dispatcher code, new requests are send to the various hosts
+ until data is detected on the transport buffers.  Then the data is processed
+ until the buffers are empty again.  This pattern is repeated until the queue
+ is empty.  This balance between sending and receiving keeps requests flowing
+ quickly, but mitigates against overloading.  This allows for dispatch queues
+ with as many requests and/or hosts as possible, as long as the Net::SNMP
+ client has the CPU/RAM resources to process them.

</div>
Are we talking about timeouts or actual &#34;timed&#34; events via -delay?  In
terms of the former, the MsgID is already properly removed and the
received packet gets thrown out, so timeouts still happen.

Also, this is sort of a Erlang-C problem, like a call center.  When
things are normal, everything gets a proper balance, in a standard
send/receive cycle.  When things are overloaded, things get REALLY
overloaded.  The receive queue gets overloaded, yet in the old code, it
keeps sending requests, when then get replies that it can&#39;t handle. 
This is just a vicious cycle that crushes the process under its own
weight, as requests time out everywhere and causes a big mess.

This is just trying to keep things more &#34;normal&#34; than not.  With this
patch, it might grab two packets instead of one before sending another
request, but that balances out the send/receives, so that it can send
what it can handle in replies.  With the old code, just by grabbing one
packet instead of two, that problem grows into that cycle of timeouts.

&gt; a single event.  When integrating into another event loop this method is
&gt; called by snmp_dispatch_once&#40;&#41;.
</div>
You already HAVE another event loop.  If all of the connections were
open via TCP, then the _event_handle would process through EACH ONE
before returning out of the sub.  If you sent 75 requests at the same
time, and they all happen to hit the bucket at the same time &#40;not
unreasonable, given that it may be the same OID&#41;, then nothing else is
going to get sent until the buffer is cleared.

So, is it a bug that UDP doesn&#39;t act the same way, or is it a bug that
TCP acts this way now?

Also, snmp_dispatch_once doesn&#39;t tell me anything about select times,
either.  I&#39;ve tried to peer at select times outside of the module, but I
ended up with inaccuracies between the select call and going in the
module.  Besides, I really shouldn&#39;t be messing with
$Dispatcher-&gt;{_descriptors} objects, as those are supposed to be
internal, anyway.  Hence the patch.

&gt; upon many variations over the past releases of the module.  
</div>
And I understand the hesitation to implement new changes to the event
processing.  But, know that I&#39;m not trying to jury-rig the code to work
with just my needs, but making it work for everybody.  Try to keep an
open-mind on these things.  I tried approaching this from outside the
module first before I realized that the most logical thing to do was to
implement a patch.

I&#39;m about done with my DBD::SNMP module, and I&#39;d like to keep from
overloading practically the entire Dispatcher.pm module when I submit it
to CPAN.

approach this with a different angle: What kind of tests would be
necessary to prove out the different use cases and make sure everything
acts predictably?  I don&#39;t want you to add the patch in because I&#39;m
being persistent, but because you&#39;re comfortable with the results.
