<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Hello,

Mouse is a nice alternative to Moose, but it would be even better if
some of the initialization guts were a little cleaner. I&#39;m playing
with Package::Alias to allow the end user to alias Moose to Mouse,
for a more transparent substitution. This way it doesn&#39;t matter if
any 3rd party code uses Moose instead of Any::Moose, Mouse is what
everything gets. Unfortunately, because %Mouse::Exporter::SPEC is
used to check callers, and it is my instead of our, to get this to
work the end-user has to call Mouse::Exporter-&gt;setup_import_methods.
And because setup_import_methods doesn&#39;t contain the defaults, but
Mouse does,

One ends up with a rather bulky initialization:

BEGIN{
    use Package::Alias Moose =&gt; Mouse;

    Moose::Exporter-&gt;setup_import_methods&#40;exporting_package=&gt;&#39;Moose&#39;,
                                      
                                      as_is =&gt; [qw&#40;
                                                        extends with
                                                        has
                                                        before after around
                                                        override super
                                                        augment  inner
                                                     &#41;,
                                                \&#38;Scalar::Util::blessed,
                                                \&#38;Carp::confess,
                                      ],
    &#41;;
}

versus:

    use Moose;

or 
    use Package::Alias Moose =&gt; Mouse;

Or perhaps you&#39;d be interested in updating Any::Moose to pull in the
necessary magic to permit this more user-friendly configuration?

  package main;
  #use Any::Moose;                 #Fallback to whichever
  use Any::Moose preferred=&gt;Mouse; #Try to force Mouse
  use Frogs;
  ...

  package Frogs;
  use Moose;                       #Frog is a Mouse

</div>Not at all. You are assuming that people use Moose because they need all of
its features and heft. I am assuming most people use Moose because they don&#39;t
know about Mouse or Any::Moose.

Therefore, the *end user* should have the ability to force code to use Mouse
if they want. If it blows up because Mouse is missing something, they&#39;ll
know not to force it. If it works as expected &#40;which seems the more probable
case&#41;, they&#39;ve saved themselves from being gored by giant antlers :-P

<div class="messagebody">
<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">You&#39;re assuming that breakage will be self evident and immediate, which is
usually not the case &#40;typically incompatibilities are due to runtime
introspection facilities that are missing in Mouse&#41;.

Secondly, the end user should just alias the package themselves, Any::Moose
is the wrong place for it. Any::Moose is specifically designed to be
generally safe &#40;though it still fails quite badly, for instance when trying
to extend an Any::Moose class with plain Moose and running into load order
issues that may cause action at a distance by causing the Any::Moose class
to be Mouse based before Moose was actually loaded&#41;.

Anyway, my point is that therein lies lots of potential brain damage for a
future maintenance programmer. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to add that to
something that is designed to be low impact.

This is more of a MooseX::Hijack::WithMouse or something like that, it
should be clear that it&#39;s an invasive change, that you can easily add as a
-M option to perl, or whatever. Putting this type of change in Any::Moose
directly will just lead modules that modify global values being uploaded to
the CPAN IMHO.

I know, I saw matt&#39;s email before I wrote this so I knew he supplied you with details I just wanted to put in my 2 
cents. I am still not 100% sure you have your facts straight. I don&#39;t think that Mouse &#34;starts-up 4 times faster than 
Moose&#34;, in fact a quick check on my machine shows that it is actually closer to 5 times faster in startup &#40;4.75 if you 
wanna be picky&#41;.

stevan% /usr/bin/time perl -MMoose -e 1
        0.19 real         0.17 user         0.02 sys
stevan% /usr/bin/time perl -MMouse -e 1
        0.04 real         0.03 user         0.00 sys

I would also disagree with your comment about Mouse implementing a subset of the &#34;more superficial and sexier 
features&#34;. Many people find the MOP to be a very sexy feature and Mouse only has very limited support for that. 
However this is trivial and your newest update to add the paragraph about the metaprotocol stuff being the &#34;raison 
d&#39;être of Moose&#34; is fine by me.

I am sorry if you feel attacked by us &#40;the Moose community&#41; however you have to understand that your post was 
somewhat on the inflammatory side. While we do discourage use of Mouse, we have no problem with people using 
Mouse if they want or need too. Your post though was advocating a rather aggressive method of altering other 
peoples code in ways that could be considered evil and at the very least invasive. We also know pretty well &#40;from 
experience with Squirrel and then Any::Moose&#41; that this technique will probably only work with the simplest of 
Moose modules and so tends to lead people to run into a lot of very hard to debug problems.

Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration, but the general idea remains. It&#39;s easier
to concvince the powers that be to review/test/install a single, smaller

Might they occasionally run into problems with code that was written against

still say &#34;use Moose&#34; rather than &#34;use Any::Moose&#34; without waiting for them
to be patched, or developing their own packages. Or, with it&#39;s foot in the
door, Moose would have a leg-up on being accepted to address Mouse&#39;s
shortcomings.

In any event, I&#39;m glad things are more less settled, and I can move on to more
pressing matters.

Sincerely,

Jerrad Pierce

Speed of test suite run is approx 4 time faster, speed of raw startup  
looked closer to 5, maybe 6 depending how how you read the output.

Moose has issues with Test::Aggregate so this wouldn&#39;t really help &#40;we  
re-use Foo as package name in the tests too often&#41;. I suspect Mouse  
would have the same issue too.

I guess what I am trying to say is that you will find only a handful  
of all the Moose based modules that don&#39;t also use MooseX:: modules  
with no equivalent MouseX:: &#40;which btw your code doesn&#39;t even address&#41;  
or some of the MOP features not supported in Mouse &#40;it happens more  
often then you might think&#41;. And even if it works today, if the module  
author made changes that didn&#39;t work with Mouse this could cause  
really ugly issues &#40;and probably a few really confusing bug reports&#41;.

As for helping bigger companies adopt Moose, well, I worry that this  
type of invasive technique would actually hurt in the long run because  
when things go bad &#40;and I am sure they will at some point&#41; it would  
look bad for Moose.

Sure, I am fine with leaving this where it is, just know &#40;and I mean  
this with no disrespect to you&#41; we will likely discourage this  
technique for anyone who comes looking for help after adopting this  
technique. It is clever, but fragile, we know we have already been  
there and seen the issues.
