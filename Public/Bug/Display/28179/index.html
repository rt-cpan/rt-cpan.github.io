Shandong Zhouyuan Seed and Nursery Co., Ltd &#40;SZSN&#41;
$0.33 UP 37.5%

Brokers are grabbing up SZSN like crazy after two news releases this
week. Huge expansion plus multi-million dollar development projects are
pushing share prices through the roof. Act fast and get on SZSN first
thing Monday!

&#34;Duping innocent users into believing that they may be helping the
tsunami disaster aid efforts shows hackers stooping to a new low,&#34; said
Graham Cluley, Sophos senior technology consultant. Do you have the
right staff? No internet presence?
When they do, the data files in the accounts package are likely to be
corrupted.

This isolation was frustrating in many ways, but at least had the merit
of keeping the data uncontaminated by outside influences. Both firms use
wording suggesting they are official enforcement bodies, but they are
not.
Company performance, profitability and investment is much stronger in
the service sector than in manufacturing according to the Institute of
Directors&#39; new report. Do you know what is happening in your company? Do
you need to reduce your costs?

Does your company have inefficient systems and procedures? The pack
contains most of the basic health and safety advice businesses need to
help them comply with the law and protect their workers.

Are you short of new ideas? Is the software or the hardware at fault?
Have you lost a key member of staff?

You have to assume that there are going to be errors some time and make
provision for them. Do you know how to sell your business?
There is an unspoken assumption here.
Business and financial risk too high?
Can you use IQ Objects?

This is as it should be, but means that the data is exposed to lots of
unpredictable influences and - with them - possible error. Do you know
anything about sarbane oxley compliance?
Unsurprisingly, company performance and optimism is notably weaker in
the manufacturing sector.

So in practice most errors are not the fault of the software at all, but
of the hardware.

Is your computer system working efficiently? Both firms use wording
suggesting they are official enforcement bodies, but they are not. Do
you know how to start your own business?
However, running the attached file will not only forward the virus to
other internet users but can also initiate a denial-of-service attack
against a German hacking website. More than half the firms surveyed said
the cost of employee regulation and paperwork had meant they employed
fewer staff than they would like.
&#34;This gruesome insensitivity is a despicable ploy to get curious
computer users to run malicious code on their computers.
Does your company have inefficient systems and procedures?
This isolation was frustrating in many ways, but at least had the merit
of keeping the data uncontaminated by outside influences. No internet
presence? These companies are asking for significant sums of money,
claiming they will send out information, much of which HSE provides free
of charge.

Have you lost a key member of staff? Is your computer system working
efficiently?

Does your company have inefficient systems and procedures?

Get advice from your package supplier on this.
And because accounts packages are the most complex of applications with
a lot of file updating, they are where errors are most likely to occur.
Does your purchase ledger department need to be efficient?

Do you know how well your business is doing?

Do you get many computer viruses? Do you get many computer viruses?

This is as it should be, but means that the data is exposed to lots of
unpredictable influences and - with them - possible error. The
opportunity to sharing knowledge and personal enjoyment ranked much
lower down the survey respondents&#39; list of reasons why they would invest
than making a good return.

Are your staff unable to deliver?
Anyone receiving literature from any of these companies can ignore it;
there is no legal need for anyone to buy literature or services from
these companies. These companies are asking for significant sums of
money, claiming they will send out information, much of which HSE
provides free of charge. Has your network been infiltrated? But if the
software has been working perfectly well for several months before the
error occurred, surely the logical conclusion ought to be the exact
opposite?

Get advice from your package supplier on this. Are you managing your
suppliers effectively? Do you have a user specification for your
systems?
You have to assume that there are going to be errors some time and make
provision for them.

Have you got a mission statement? Do you have a user specification for
your systems?
Are you maximising the revenue from your assets?
