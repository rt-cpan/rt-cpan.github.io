<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Brokers Move On ERMX!

EntreMetrix Inc. &#40;ERMX&#41;
$0.18

Heavy trading today as ERMX announced its launch of digital support
tools for its portfolio companies. Brokers are getting ahead of this
steady climb as they grab up large blocks of shares for there clients.
Look at the numbers and get on ERMX Friday morning!

&#34;It&#39;s not really food, Corinne, but it is better than nothing. Without
missing a beat, I point out that this means I am having an inappropriate
relationship with a student and will get my hand slapped. He slowly made
his way over to us and I asked if I could take his picture.

I&#39;ll endure classroom lessons and will learn prodigiously, but will
experience active irritation that someone is wasting my time when
singled out for &#34;mentoring.

I scoffed at the ruse of being a male protector to walk three blocks
from an art show, but play along.

I can hear a dozen stories about a person and still be almost surprised
that they are real when the eventual meeting occurs. Amazingly and to
their credit, this trivia does not lose me my new friends.
Dan Kessler, the only of my people I managed to successfully invite, had
more interest in exploring the only street in Tivoli that seems to
count.

I didn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t have done this overtly, but high school presented
its own drama and she only ever had a walk-on role. I, mud, sat up and
saw what a nice job God had done. &#34;Ben, this is Thomm Quackenbush. This
gave Christine and her friend an excuse to ask me to walk them to
Hanna&#39;s car. Instead, for spite, I sniffed at it. To know that she
thinks me lower than I think her is much harder than the amorphous
speculation.
I certainly couldn&#39;t have.

A girl named Christine joining me in my wine wafting.

&#34;It&#39;s not really food, Corinne, but it is better than nothing.

In high school, we were passing friends at best.

I&#39;m not certain why I bought it - I had never heard of him and was only
a year out of my Goosebumps stage - but felt immediately drawn to the
clown on the cover. She severed an artery and that truck had been soaked
in her blood as my father drove her to the hospital. Soon in Xenology:
Masters.

I felt I should let the viewer decide if this makes me divine or
infernal, though for comfort the costume quickly reduced to simply the
t-shirt and jeans, losing all pretense of potentiality. I couldn&#39;t go
after her to introduce her to Dan, no matter the degree of idiocy I
display to actual social mores. I&#39;ve already taken to half joking that I
need to stop revering writers, as it invariably leads to their death. We
do not speak, we chatted only once.

She immediately jokes that she knows that because she is in my classes.
&#34;I&#39;ve heard of you,&#34; she repeated with due emphasis.

I don&#39;t think I will be engulfed by anything spectral that I cannot
handle.

I feel utterly safe among the headstones, spiritual and almost at peace.

But for the low light level on the street at this hour, I would have
already done it a dozen times.
Had he not gone that day, him might have lived to see the atrocity of
the newest Hitchhiker&#39;s movie. I scoffed at the ruse of being a male
protector to walk three blocks from an art show, but play along. I
wanted more of an interaction and Kristin chided Dan for not seizing the
opportunity to flirt with an attractive woman in need who I guarantee
would have been receptive.
Given his milieu, rope seemed a cutting choice of weapon, but it turned
out that he shot himself or overdosed on pills.

I pause and wonder if this is true and how long this has been thought of
me.

I again felt that flare between Kristin and me as I wondered how she
knew Dan was single and, furthermore, knew that this girl would have
adored Dan after five sentences. I repent that I was ever the person
that unconsciously dissuaded her from actually knowing me.
&#34;  Or perhaps killing my battery is their response, telling me
effectively that there was nothing they wished to show me. We were never
the best of friends, but we are also never less than friends.
I didn&#39;t read all of his books with the next month or even year, much as
I wish I could claim otherwise.
