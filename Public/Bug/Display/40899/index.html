The error occurs in the first iteration of

}

Investigation showed that the data returned by $st-&gt;spaceflight 
&#40;&#39;-all&#39;&#41; includes a group of TLEs for the shuttle, plus a group of 
TLEs for the ISS. For some reason the shuttle TLEs are giving the 
algorithm fits.

To fix this &#40;currently&#41; I added a

shift @sats;

right after the data is aggregated into the @sats set objects. This 
discards the shuttle TLEs, and the ISS TLEs are then successfully 
used.

A better solution would be to enhance the above loop through the 
@sats array to trap any algorithm errors and continue.


Thanks for the code,
Dan

&#34;Doc, it hurts when I do this.&#34;

&#34;Then don&#39;t DO that.&#34;

I assume that you&#39;re trying to calculate satellite passes rather than
iridium flares, title to the contrary notwithstanding. Yes, there are a
POT LOAD of modules in this distribution.

I have an update in preparation already due to ticket 40113 &#40;another
bogus SYNOPSIS -- Astro::Coord::ECI::Moon&#39;s example didn&#39;t say the
latitude and longitude were in radians&#41;; I&#39;ll just tail-end onto that.

I know I have had to solve this problem before, in the satpass script,
and under exactly the same circumstances &#40;NASA had the predicted TLEs on
line but the shuttle had not yet launched&#41;. The idea is that we need to
disallow the use of data before its epoch date.

The answer _might_ be as simple as inserting

$tle-&gt;set&#40;backdate =&gt; 0&#41;;

just before the &#39;push @passes, $tle-&gt;pass&#40;$loc, $start, $finish&#41;;&#39;

Without this line I was able to duplicate your error. With it, I was
able to get passes for the shuttle next week. The output seems to show
it about a minute behind the ISS next Wednesday &#40;Nov 19 2008&#41;, but I
think it&#39;s actually docked, assuming they launch on the 14th. I&#39;ll have
to run actual data from SpaceTrack once it&#39;s available to see if the
problem is my code or NASA&#39;s data. Both are possible; NASA is the rocket
scientists, not me, but the shuttle TLEs are estimated, and I have seen
them do some strange things in times past.

It would be nice if the backdate attribute would default false, but it&#39;s
true because that was the behaviour before that attribute was added, and
I hate to change default behaviour. I&#39;m working on abandoning
Astro-satpass, moving the Astro::Coord::ECI classes into a package of
that name, and redoing the satpass script as App::Satpass2. If the
latter ever sees the light of day, it may default &#39;backdate&#39; to false.

I regret to say that I will almost certainly NOT have an updated
Astro-satpass out before Endeavour launches - but once you&#39;ve passed the
epoch of the first shuttle TLE the problem goes away anyway. There have
been a couple under-the hood changes I want to put to bed: getting rid
of all uses of UNIVERSAL::isa &#40;as opposed to $object-&gt;isa&#41;;
incorporating Time::y2038 &#40;pretty much done I think&#41;, and moving the
USGS height query to a separate module &#40;mostly done, but this is
probably the critical path&#41;.

Thanks for your response. My main concern was NOT that the TLEs break 
the algorithm, but that your demo code fails inscrutably &#40;at the 
moment&#41;, and since that&#39;s the way a lot of people will be figuring 
out how your packages work that failure will be difficult to surmount 
&#40;it took me an hour or so of trial and error before I figured out 
that it was the shuttle TLEs&#41;.

Once I finally got the satellite pass &#40;yes, not Iridium flare&#41; code 
working I then started looking at the data at various parts of the 
process in order to figure out just what was going on. I then started 
modifying it step by step towards my own application. Having the 
working program made it a LOT easier.

So, my suggestion is that you adjust the demo code so that it prints 
an error &#40;perhaps &#34;Something&#39;s wrong with the TLEs for satellite 
SHUTTLE; continuing&#34;&#41; and then continues.

Beyond that, it would have helped me if there was more overview 
information, giving context to exactly what the process should be. 
Yes, you provide a whole Satpass application that uses the packages, 
but frankly for us non-Perl-gurus it&#39;s really difficult to trace how 
a Perl program works. More simple demonstrations would also have 
helped.

I certainly agree with you that sample code should _not_ fail
inscrutably, and the patch I sent you is all set to go into the next
release. I think it took me about the same amount of time to figure the
problem out originally, but problems should not have to be figured out
more than once.

I may break down and add some comments about the need for setting
&#39;backdate&#39; false. As my copy of the code now stands, it&#39;s commented
something like &#34;maybe this should be the default&#34;. But in the vast
majority of cases there is no problem with using TLEs before their
epoch.  All TLEs will have problems like this eventually, it&#39;s just a
question of time, either before _or_ after the epoch of the data.

It might be good if objects built from NASA&#39;s Human Spaceflight data
were set up with backdate =&gt; 0 automatically, but I&#39;m not sure I see the
best way to carry that information from the Astro::SpaceTrack package
into the Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE-&gt;parse&#40;&#41; method. Right now I can imagine
having parse&#40;&#41; able to digest an HTTP::Response object &#40;which is what
Astro::SpaceTrack returns&#41; and then have Astro::SpaceTrack add a custom
response header with the data, which the parse&#40;&#41; method reacts to. But I
just thought of that 5 minutes ago, and I haven&#39;t had time to consider
possible problems with it.

I&#39;m not sure exactly how to respond here. If I expand the SYNOPSIS too
much it becomes the DETAILS. Are you asking for a &#34;How to use this class
in your own code&#34; section of some sort? Or &#34;quick start&#34; documentation
for the satpass script? Or an overview document for the whole package?
Would you be willing to answer questions about where you entered the
documentation and why? Or do documentation review? In many ways the
author of a piece of code is the least qualified to document it. Or test
it, for that matter.

There are a couple more examples &#40;working, last time I checked&#41; in the
eg directory. Did you look there? Unfortunately if you&#39;re using
ActiveState PPMs you don&#39;t get these. And if you&#39;re using CPAN or
CPANPLUS you have to go looking for them. One way to get there is to go
to <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Astro-satpass/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Astro-satpass/</a></span> and hit the &#34;browse&#34; link
near the top of the page. Unfortunately the &#34;browse&#34; link is
version-specific, so I can&#39;t add it to the documentation.

Thanks. It&#39;s the old bootstrap problem, plus the problem that trivial
examples may not be helpful, and significant examples may not be trivial.

I could certainly go into each of the questions you ask, but if I were
to go into them in the comments in the sample, maybe you would not be
able to see the code for the comments. I have seen SYNOPSIS sections
with brief comments and extended notes after the code. How does this
strike you?

Maybe I should go into the questions now, and we can figure out where
the answers go later.

&gt; Astro::SpaceTrack package?
</div>
The Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE package implements a model &#40;several models,
actually&#41; of a satellite in orbit around the Earth. This is not simply a
Keplerian ellipse, because of a number of factors such as oblateness of
the Earth, atmospheric drag &#40;believe it or not!&#41; and orbital resonance
&#40;for 12- and 24-hour orbits anyway&#41;, and possibly more.

The net result is that the model needs data on which to work, and the
job of the Astro::SpaceTrack package is to retrieve this data from any
of a number of possible sources. The standard representation of the data
for a given satellite is either two or three lines of text which owe
their format to the days of 80-column punched cards. This format is
called &#34;TLE&#34; for &#34;Two Line Element&#34;. The three-line variant is sometimes
called &#34;NASA TLE&#34;, though you could simply take the &#34;T&#34; to mean &#34;three&#34;
in this case. See <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/tle-fmt.asp">http://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/tle-fmt.asp</a></span>
if you want the gory details of the format.

NORAD &#40;among others&#41; generates this data by observing all the satellites
and other stuff &#40;spent boosters, astronauts&#39; lost gloves, and so on&#41;,
and running a big regression program for each to generate TLE data that,
when plugged back into the model, best predicts the observed locations
of the satellite. This data is characterized by an &#34;epoch&#34;, which is the
&#34;as-of&#34; date of the data.

The data has &#40;as you discovered&#41; a limited shelf life. How limited
depends on the specifics of the individual satellite. Typically it&#39;s
weeks or even months either side of the epoch &#40;though of course
prediction quality suffers&#41;. For a space shuttle on its first coasting
arc, though, it&#39;s a day or so.

What I think happens in the specific case of the first coasting arc of
the Space Shuttle is that if you run that orbit back in time, you
essentially have to run an unusually high atmospheric drag backwards as
well, and after a couple days the model thinks the shuttle came in on an
escape orbit, which the model can&#39;t deal with. The cryptic error message
reflects the fact that at the next step in the calculations the model is
going to attempt to take the square root of a negative number.

</div>
This is the code that takes the TLE data &#40;returned by Astro::SpaceTrack&#41;
and makes it into Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE objects &#40;or
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Iridium objects, if that&#39;s what the data you fed
it actually represents&#41;.

</div>
Well, one answer is because the code &#34;just growed&#34;.

Most sources of satellite orbit data typically provide a single set of
data per satellite. The NASA Human Spaceflight web pages at
<span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/elements/">http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/elements/</a></span> provide multiple sets for
the same object.

As originally written, the code that used this data simply scraped the
web page and picked the &#34;best&#34; element to return. &#34;Best&#34; was defined as
&#34;most recent epoch before the current time, or the earliest epoch if the
current time was before any of the posted date. This caused the same
kind of error you encountered, only at that point the error message was
even more cryptic.

Once I understood how and why the code was failing, I had to figure out
what to do about it. The solution I came up with was a container object
&#40;Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Set&#41; that would hold any number of individual
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE objects that represent the same satellite at
different points in time. The container would expose all the methods of
the contained objects, and dispatch any method calls to the &#34;best&#34; one,
with &#34;best&#34; being defined pretty much the way it was in the previous
paragraph. Any method that set the time, of course, had to be overridden
to also select the &#34;best&#34; object.

The net result is that Astro::SpaceTrack give you a couple dozen lines
of text representing one or two orbiting bodies. The
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE-&gt;parse&#40;&#41; method turns these into a dozen or so
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE objects representing one or two orbiting bodies.
And finally Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Set-&gt;aggregate&#40;&#41; generates one or
two Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Set objects, each containing the
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE objects for exactly one satellite. When you call
pass&#40;&#41; on the ::Set object, it uses whichever is the &#34;best&#34; object for
whatever time it&#39;s working on.

If you call &#39;set&#40;backdate =&gt; 0&#41;&#39;, it &#40;among other things&#41; tells the
pass&#40;&#41; method not to do any calculations for times earlier than the
earliest data epoch it has access to.

&gt; package?
</div>
When I document this, the answer will probably be something on the order
of &#34;See the Astro::SpaceTrack documentation&#34;, though a quick look says
that first I&#39;ll need to make sure that this is actually documented
there. Briefly, one of the sources of data is the Space Track web site
at <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.space-track.org/">http://www.space-track.org/</a></span>

The predecessor of this site provided data to anyone who surfed over to
it. But in the wake of 9/11/2001, a law was passed saying that you had
to register to get the data, and at that point it looked like it was
going to be illegal to redistribute it. One of the major redistributors
was Dr. Kelso of Celestrak, at <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://celestrak.com/">http://celestrak.com/</a></span>. He revamped his
web site &#40;which offers TLE data for several groups of satellites of
interest&#41; so that all he provided was the object ID of satellites in the
group. You found &#40;say&#41; all the Iridium satellites by consulting his web
site, then hit SpaceTrack to get the data on them.

What eventually happened was that it became possible to register to be a
redistributor of the data &#40;thanks in part to Dr. Kelso&#39;s lobbying&#41;.

The Astro::SpaceTrack module has had to track all these shenannigans, so
it has become a bit complicated. The current situation is that you must
provide a SpaceTrack username and password if you:

* Fetch your data directly from SpaceTrack &#40;i.e. use the
Astro::SpaceTrack methods that are documented to do this&#41;, or

* Fetch your data from Celestrak &#40;i.e. use the methods documented to do
this, which I think means the celestrak&#40;&#41; method&#41;, _AND_ you have the
&#39;direct&#39; attribute set false. In this case, Astro::SpaceTrack gets the
object ID numbers from Celestrak, and then hits SpaceTrack for the data.
If &#39;direct&#39; is true, it fetches all data from Celestrak, if possible
&#40;and it typically is, since Dr. Kelso is registered as a redistributor&#41;.

This is one of the methods that gets TLE data directly from Space Track,
and hence needs a username and password.

&gt; Anything I receive you &#40;including cracks&#41; beyond this code is more 
&gt; than I can expect. There&#39;s not a lot I can contribute to your code, 
&gt; except for expressing confusion in as clear a manner as possible in 
&gt; order to show you how others are trying to use your package.
&gt; 
</div>
Expressing confusion in a clear manner is a rare talent. I recall a tech
writer who was a typical &#34;dumb user&#34; with a twist that made her
invaluable. When she got herself balled up in the system, she could tell
you afterward what she did to get balled up, and why she did it. There
were a number of code changes based on her ways to get tangled in the
system.

&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  Yes, you provide a whole Satpass application that uses the packages,
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  but frankly for us non-Perl-gurus it&#39;s really difficult to trace how
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  a Perl program works. More simple demonstrations would also have
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  helped.
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</div>&gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt;I&#39;m not sure exactly how to respond here. If I expand the SYNOPSIS too
&gt;&gt;  &gt;much it becomes the DETAILS.
</div>&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I found it difficult to understand the overall work flow for the
&gt;&gt;  system. Just what is the &#34;data&#34; that is returned by the
&gt;&gt;  Astro::SpaceTrack package? What is returned by
&gt;&gt;  Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE-&gt;parse&#40;&#41;? Why would I want to aggregate it?
&gt;&gt;  When do I need to specify login info to the Astro::SpaceTrack
&gt;&gt;  package? Where does Astro::SpaceTrack-&gt;retrieve&#40;&#41; get its info?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I think I was missing the forest for the trees. Until I got your demo
&gt;&gt;  code working I really had no clue as to how it would all function.
&gt;&gt;  After that, I just started stepping through the code and watching the
&gt;&gt;  values.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  FYI, my access route to all this was search.cpan.org.
</div>&gt;
&gt;Thanks. It&#39;s the old bootstrap problem, plus the problem that trivial
&gt;examples may not be helpful, and significant examples may not be trivial.
&gt;
&gt;I could certainly go into each of the questions you ask, but if I were
&gt;to go into them in the comments in the sample, maybe you would not be
&gt;able to see the code for the comments. I have seen SYNOPSIS sections
&gt;with brief comments and extended notes after the code. How does this
&gt;strike you?
&gt;
&gt;Maybe I should go into the questions now, and we can figure out where
&gt;the answers go later.
</div>
I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t clear. I&#39;ve for the most part figured out all of 
these questions on my own, by trial-and-error and value examination. 
At the moment  I think I&#39;m up to speed on the system &#40;although my 
opinion may change at any moment depending on what I try next&#41;. I was 
just trying to give you a flavor of what information I wasn&#39;t able to 
find in the documentation.

Do you have a website, or somewhere you could post a page with an 
overview of the system? A document going over how it all hangs 
together, independent of each package&#39;s doc, might have helped me a 
lot.

Again, I&#39;m not looking for more information at this point; I was just 
trying to give some semi-helpful feedback.


Thanks,

Thanks. One of my favorite aphorisms says &#34;The greatest danger of
communication is the illusion that it occurred.&#34; So maybe I have a
tendency to over communicate, as a way to avoid the reverse.

The only web site I maintain is a fairly sketchy one used for sharing
photos with friends. I have tried to put together an overview document
&#40;called &#34;Overview&#34;&#41; which I hope &#40;if I work CPAN right&#41; to have show up
in the &#34;documentation&#34; section on search.cpan.org. Since you said you
found this package through search.cpan.org, I&#39;m assuming others will too
&#40;that&#39;s how _I_ would&#41;. And anyway I believe the overview _should_ be
with the package. I&#39;ll need to refer to it in the other docs so that
people who just install and start reading the module docs will find it.

Fine, and I appreciate the feedback. In case you are willing to give
more, I have attached the Overview document as it now stands. The
recommended way to read it is to download it, change to the directory
you downloaded it to, and say

 perldoc Overview.pod

The document _should_ show up as HTML on search.cpan.org. But before I
release I need to check the internal links, which I have not done.

Thank you very much for your willingness to work with me.
