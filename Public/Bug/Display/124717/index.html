This can be reduced to

    %:: = &#40;&#41;;
    *STDOUT-&gt;foo;

The whole main stash is emptied, then using an IO glob as an object in a
method call lookup triggers requiring IO::File, which &#40;on debugging
builds&#41; dies with this assertion:

perl: hv.c:360: Perl_hv_common: Assertion `&#40;&#40;svtype&#41;&#40;&#40;hv&#41;-&gt;sv_flags &#38; 0xff&#41;&#41; == SVt_PVHV&#39; failed.

This is because something expected to be a hash has been freed and then
reused as a different type of scalar.

Although in an ideal world we&#39;d like perl not to crash when the main stash
is emptied, it&#39;s not a terribly high priority, and its definitely not a
security issue.
