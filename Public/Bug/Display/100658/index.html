<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">I compared the code with what the documentation states. It doesn&#39;t correspond. According to the documentation the module is about automating tasks across servers using ssh and stuff like this.

In reality the module does, among other things:

- requests root permissions here and there &#40;see RT#97421&#41;
- installs and removes software &#40;local and remote&#41; like apache, mysql and so forth
- maintains amazon ec2 and aws instances
- installs and removes perl modules
- creates and deletes files and directories in remote and local directories
- calls tar, transfers tarballs, unpacks and removes them on various occurences in the code
- creates/modifies crontab entries
- lot of more stuff I didn&#39;t have the time even trying to understand

While the documentation talks about security, the module nevertheless stores passwords to berkeley db files. Yes, those are encrypted, but what about the encryption key? It&#39;s stored elsewhere, since this thing&#39;s main purpose is to run from cron. Obviously the author hasn&#39;t ever heard of ssh keys.

A couple of notes about the code: it&#39;s a bloated mess in one 1.4 mb file, FA_Core.pm. There are 174 subs, many of them are duplicates &#40;e.g. there are 4 subs &#34;cwd&#34;&#41;. There are 36 packages within FA_Core.pm, most of them declared inside subs. About 20-30% of the code is redundant, i.e. duplicated all over the module. The file is soo large, that it is impossible to understand for an outsider. It uses hundrets of global variables for everything. While it uses lots of external modules it also does many things on its own &#40;in weird ways, e.g. handling of times and dates&#41;, eg:

 %hourconv=&#40;&#39;12:00am&#39;=&gt;0,&#39; 1:00am&#39;=&gt;1,&#39; 2:00am&#39;=&gt;2,&#39; 3:00am&#39;=&gt;3, [..];
 [..]
 $hourstring=$hourconv{unpack&#40;&#39;x6 a*&#39;,$output-&gt;[4]-&gt;[0]&#41;};

Also there are hardcoded mime-types, path&#39;s, programs, etc.

The module should - if any - be rewritten from scratch. In its current state it can&#39;t be trusted.

This is a 15 year old POC project. There are reasons for each and every one of your concerns. Some of the reasons are good, some not so good. For instance, the custom date logic was used because it performed much better than any date manipulation modules available at the time. Today, almost certainly a date module can replace most if not all of it. But that&#39;s a big task, and as you have witnessed, there are no shortage of &#34;big&#34; tasks this project has left in it.

Basically, this monster didn&#39;t even &#34;work&#34; until about 4 years ago, and I have been engaged in trying to &#34;package&#34; this thing into a usable utility ever since. There has been a LOT of cleanup already &#40;believe it or not!&#41; and much more is planned.

This thing actually WORKS and I will put a YouTube video together shortly demonstrating what it can do. It definitely needs re-factoring - but you&#39;re clearly suggesting that it be &#34;scrapped&#34;, without any true or comprehensive understanding of what this thing is, and what it does.

You probably spent 20 minutes trying to make sense out of a 15 year project. There is nothing wrong with that, but I would not expect anyone to be able to comprehend what this is and does by simply doing a quick survey of the source code. This project has had thousands and thousands of development hours patiently poured into it to achieve a very specific goal. That goal &#34;programmatic automation over a PERSISTENT ssh connection&#34; has been achieved. This monster works and its FAST. And it &#34;will&#34; be easy to install and use. I don&#39;t know if it will ever be easy to &#34;understand&#34; at a core code level however - no matter how much documentation I produce &#40;and yes, so far, I have produced precious little, and most of that is horribly outdated&#41;.

I am working to improve EVERYTHING you&#39;ve outlined, but this is battleship, and it can&#39;t be turned quickly.

Again, it didn&#39;t even &#34;work&#34; until about 4 years ago, and along the way, there was no point in cleaning up code that didn&#39;t even work.

Now that it works, I&#39;ve got a titanic mess on my hands - admittedly. But it is a very valuable and ground-breaking, even revolutionary &#34;mess&#34;. This *will* be a game changer. It is now, actually, as I have demos built for Amazon that show all of it&#39;s impressive capabilities.

Please communicate just what out of &#34;all&#34; your concerns you view as the &#34;most&#34; pressing and I will attempt to make some short term headway on it.

Yes - I acknowledge that. However it can and will be updated to earn this &#34;trust&#34;. It will take time, and it won&#39;t happen overnight. But it WILL happen.

Besides, the upmost priority would be to stop spamming CPAN with multiple daily uploads of the module. CPAN is no revision control system. You cannot produce a new release for each single line change. That&#39;s crazy. Use git or svn for this and make a new release if a couple of bugs have been fixed or a new feature is completely implemented.

<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">I&#39;m not using CPAN as source control. I&#39;m not &#34;spamming&#34; either - in the
sense of trying to &#34;sell&#34; this module in an unorthodox fashion. The
multiple uploads are work on the installer. FullAuto has a LOT of
dependency modules. Two years ago it took the better part of a full day to
get FullAuto and all its dependencies installed. With that kind of effort
required to get it running, no one was going to use it. So the last two
years was basically spent in solving &#34;that&#34; problem. Now FullAuto can be
installed with ALL it&#39;s dependencies in less than 15 minutes - often in as
little as 8 minutes. I tried to use CPAN as documented for this task, but
it proved woefully inadequate. BerkeleyDB is a case in point. The FullAuto
install now installs this without intervention on all Linux/Unix and
Windows with Cygwin.

I&#39;ve tried using local mirrors, and while that allowed some level of
independence from CPAN, there were issues that only appeared when using
CPAN itself, especially when installing on Amazon EC2 micro instances.

I&#39;m not &#34;comfortable&#34; that I&#39;m clearly irritating you - and yes, I will
concede that you are very likely the &#34;voice&#34; of others as well.

The number of uploads has slowed down, and will continue to do so. My goal
is to get to a release schedule that spans months - not days.

90% of the uploads are a direct consequence of CPAN issues, or issues with
other author&#39;s modules and how they get installed, and my attempts to work
it all out - I am not doing it as an alternative to svn or git.

As for documentation, nobody is using this yet, for reasons you have
outlined in addition to others.

The software that is closest to what FullAuto does is Chef and Puppet.
&#40;And yes, I can hear your laughter from here&#41;. You won&#39;t be laughing for
long.

Everything you&#39;re complaining about is fixable, and it WILL get fixed.
What FullAuto does, and how it does it will insure that will happen.

Chef requires 10 GIG of hard disk space on every node. Chef requires TWO
way communication between nodes and the Chef server. FullAuto requires
ZERO disk space on ANY node, and requires only a one-way connection from
the FullAuto installation to the node via PERSISTENT SSH. FullAuto runs
commands from one script on one host and controls any number of other
hosts simultaneously - again via persistent SSH. The FullAuto demo that is
nearly complete, installs itself on an Amazon micro server, and then
proceeds to use the Amazon API to launch other servers, download Liferay
&#40;LDAP is another demo. Hadoop is next&#41;, build it from source, install
MySQL on yet another host, start it, download and import Liferay&#39;s schema,
and exchange configuration information among the hosts so in the end a
multi-host application infrastructure starts up and is production ready -
without ANY manual intervention. FullAuto can stand up any number of
servers, install Chef, configure it on every node, and start it - with NO
manual intervention.

Chef in turn, cannot do the same, because before it can do anything, it
has to be installed EVERYWHERE. FullAuto has no such dependency. Even it&#39;s
own installation is &#34;FULL&#34; - Auto. That is why it&#39;s Makefile.PL file is
over 7000 lines of code.

Many pundits have opined that automation utilities like Chef and Puppet
are woefully under-utilized. I AGREE - and it&#39;s because both of them are
difficult to setup and use.

I am trying to remedy that. But the cost of that is insanely complex code.
There is always a trade-off.

FullAuto dynamically discovers the prompt on remote hosts, dynamically
discovers the shell and the location of all key utilities. FullAuto
returns stdout, stderr and return codes from each command it runs on the
remote hosts. All FullAuto needs to fully control a remote host is a
hostname or ip address, login id, and password or key file. Basically,
anything anyone can do manually over a SSH/SFTP &#40;telnet or ftp&#41;
connection, FullAuto can do programmatically, and with minimal code.
FullAuto even cleans up and shuts down everything automatically - even
after a CTRL-C interrupt.

And all this power runs on a MICRO server.

Please point me to anything else that does all this?

Something this all-encompassing is going to be seriously complex, and for
me personally, having everything in a few files is easier for me to cope
with than everything broken out into a gazillion modules. Some of that
will change soon, but probably not as much as you would probably advocate.

    onclick="fold_message_stanza(this, 'Show\x20quoted\x20text', 'Hide\x20quoted\x20text');">Show quoted text</span><br /><div class="message-stanza closed">&gt; I didn&#39;t criticize if or how it works. The issue at hand is that the
&gt; documentation mentions about 5% of what the module does and even that 5%
&gt; are not even true all the time; and that the code does security
&gt; relevant/dangerous things wihout any notice anywhere.
</div>
CPAN itself uses sudo and has it as one of it&#39;s setup options. There&#39;s not
a &#34;lot&#34; of documentation on it&#39;s internal usage &#40;short of studying the
code itself&#41;, and I haven&#39;t noticed any &#34;notice&#34; about when and how it
decides to use it once you elect it as an option. So why are you
criticizing &#34;me&#34; for doing the same? You can&#39;t even use apt-get or yum
without sudo. How in the world am I to automate ANYTHING without
occasional judicial and carefully invoked super-user access, and if I&#39;m
asking the user for permission every time I do use sudo &#40;which might be
dozens and dozens of times during a multi-host standup&#41;, then we don&#39;t
have a &#34;FullAuto&#34; process - do we?

And by the way, Amazon doesn&#39;t use passwords &#40;except for Windows&#41;, only
key files. So by extension, FullAuto uses only key files when working
against Amazon.

I want people to seriously use this &#34;someday&#34; and of course they won&#39;t
without adequate documentation - so that WILL be remedied, and soon.

Again, I am not &#34;trying&#34; to irritate you or anyone else. When I have
problems with CPAN and third party module installation that I cannot
remedy or adequately debug and fix with a local mirror, what else would
you have me do?

I took a look at your Makefile.PL:

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

There are some simple rules for perl module installers:

- a perl module doesn&#39;t install any other perl module
- it doesn&#39;t assume root or admin permissions
  &#40;hint: perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/lib; make install&#41;
- this one is a NO GO:
  open&#40;LD,&#34;sudo yum -y install &#39;openssl-devel&#39;|&#34;&#41;;
- it declares its dependencies
- use at least ExtUtils::MakeMaker
- 275k for Makefile.PL is 274k too much

&gt; WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!
&gt;
&gt; There are some simple rules for perl module installers:
&gt;
&gt; - a perl module doesn&#39;t install any other perl module
&gt; - it doesn&#39;t assume root or admin permissions
&gt;   &#40;hint: perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/lib; make install&#41;
&gt; - this one is a NO GO:
&gt;   open&#40;LD,&#34;sudo yum -y install &#39;openssl-devel&#39;|&#34;&#41;;
&gt; - it declares its dependencies
&gt; - use at least ExtUtils::MakeMaker
&gt; - 275k for Makefile.PL is 274k too much

Hi, I&#39;m a member of the Perl Toolchain Gang, the working group tasked with
maintaining and developing the core toolchain modules.  Can you elaborate on
your &#34;cpan issues&#34; here that necessitate new uploads?  What are you trying to

<div class="messagebody">
<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Hi Karen and Ed - thanks for your interest. I&#39;d like to correct that
statement. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m having issues with &#34;CPAN&#34; per se, but rather
with modules that I use as dependencies for Net::FullAuto. One of the
biggest problems I&#39;ve had making FullAuto &#34;accessible&#34; to anyone who wants
to try or use it, was the lengthy, and very complicated installation and
configuration. FullAuto uses a whopping 137 &#40;not including FullAuto
itself&#41; dependency modules from CPAN. Most of those are of course
dependencies of dependencies. Send::Email - a module included in
FullAuto&#39;s dependency chain, has a huge number of dependencies all on it&#39;s
own. So does Moose of course. As good as the cpan shell and installer are,
I could never get it to correctly manage this massive dependency chain.
Inevitably, the installation would fail because of a missing dependency in
one of the long sub-chains of dependencies. Not necessarily the fault of
CPAN itself either, because module authors themselves are of course
responsible for making sure their stuff plays well with others. &#40;And yes,
I am not unaware of the obvious hypocrisy of that statement&#41;. One noted
example is Module::Build &#34;recommends&#34; Pod::Readme - but Pod::Readme
requires Module::Build to be installed! A classic circular dependency. Now
of course, this is precisely why it&#39;s &#34;recommended&#34; and not &#34;required&#34; -
but I still spent upwards of half a day some time back fighting with this
because I try to supply recommended modules as much as possible. The
answer was of course to install Pod::Readme AFTER a full install of
Module::Build, but that became obvious only in hindsight. Today - I don&#39;t
include Pod::Readme, because it turns out it has a dependency chain of
it&#39;s own that I decided was too much baggage for a module that was only
&#34;recommended&#34;.

There is clearly a trend and philosophy to break out more and more
functionality into separate modules, and while there are clearly benefits
to this trend, the cost is increased complexity in the dependency tree of
modules like mine.

With a dependency tree numbering 137 and growing, hardly a day goes by
that someone isn&#39;t updating one of more of these modules. That alone has
created massive problems for me that the generic cpan module is simply not
robust enough to cope with. Inevitably some module in the dependency chain
will require a newer version of a module than is available in the local
Perl installation. On some occasions, the updated module will be installed
into the SITE branch, but the older module is in the VENDOR branch - so
now you have two conflicting modules on the system and because VENDOR is
usually the parent in the @INC array, the installing module finds the
older one and breaks. Even if I delete the offending older module, I have
to re-run Makefile.PL from the top in order to pick up the new correct
module - doing that with an exec.

Then there&#39;s the problem of some module authors asking for user input. I&#39;m
trying to make FullAuto &#34;consumer&#34; available and not just to Perl
programmers familiar with cpan and Perl idiosyncrasies. One of the JSON
modules does this, and a &#34;consumer&#34; &#40;again, someone not familiar with Perl
and/or CPAN&#41; is not going to know how to answer such a query. Not to
mention, I want a seamless, non-interactive install for the entire
dependency chain and this one module alone breaks that. So I needed a way
to feed arguments to Makefile.PL that cpan simply doesn&#39;t provide a
facility for &#40;that I am aware of - I could be wrong of course&#41;. So, I had
to build my own.

BerekelyDB is another classic example of a module needing arguments fed to
it via either arguments to Makefile.PL or via environment variables.

Then there&#39;s Win32::API which still doesn&#39;t work without a patch on 64 bit
Windows. The author has yet to fix this &#40;no foul, everyone is
volunteering, and no one is &#34;obligated&#34;&#41;, but I can&#39;t wait months of even
years. So I need a way to dynamically patch such modules myself during
installation. Again something the generic cpan does not have a facility
for &#40;again, that I am aware of&#41;. I know others have opened tickets on the
issue with the author - which only fueled the need for a fix I could
introduce myself. Again, I can&#39;t afford to wait.

And finally, cpan ran out of memory on some Amazon EC2 micro machine
instances when trying to install modules such as Email::Sender with large
dependency trees. The only way I could work around this was to install all
it&#39;s dependencies myself before I installed Email::Sender - and other
modules. FullAuto works extremely well on Amazon micro instances, and
since that is going to be one of its big advantages, &#40;versus competitors
like Chef and Puppet&#41;, having memory and installation issues on these
hosts was of course &#34;not acceptable&#34;.

There are yet more reasons I had to deviate from protocol, but the point
is there are &#34;reasons&#34; for every line of code in my Makefile.PL. I am
chasing a 15 year goal - and that goal is now in reach. I had to make
FullAuto ACCESSIBLE to users, because no one is going to spend a day or
more on a complex installation with hundreds of opportunities for human
error to complicate things even more. There was simply no other way for me
to proceed. &#40;Again, that I was or am aware of - I am open to any and all
suggestions&#41;.

But all that said, I would have LOVED and would LOVE to have access to a
CPAN that can deliver a seamless installation of a complex architecture -
and I will try and assist in any way I can to help make that happen. More
than likely though, that will be accomplished by others someday - and
perhaps with the help of paid FullAuto contributors even.

I have done my best to turn off CPAN Testing - as it has come to my
attention that the FullAuto installation was causing problems. For that I
apologize, it is not my desire to cause issues for anyone, especially
volunteers who are being extremely generous with their time. If there is
something else I need to do, please let me know.

Ed - I am not using CPAN for source control, though I acknowledge that it
can appear that way to outsiders. I have my own local svn setup I use. I
do plan to set up GIT on Sourceforge, but that task is on a LONG list of
to-dos. The frequent uploads are about corrections made to the entire
FullAuto installation chain of events that cpan is an integral part of.
Most of this type of work is finished, and the frequency of uploads will
decrease dramatically.

I am including you on this email reply to Karen, because this reply
contains details about why there has been so much activity.

Again, thanks for your interest.

Brian Kelly

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	There are some practical solutions for these problems outside stomping on files that aren&#39;t yours.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	For instance, some applications use &quot;Fatpacking&quot;, an approach where cpan modules are essentially &quot;Inlined&quot; as a step in the release process.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Another approach is &quot;bundling&quot;, where you store the trees of dependencies you *can* safely install directly in somewhere like bundled/ , and then have code in Makefile.PL that copies those files into a prefix.</p>

<p>
	For instance, say you wanted Class::Tiny to be &quot;bundled&quot; for some reason.</p>

<p>
	You *could* do this by storing it in<br>

	<br>

	bundled/Class/Tiny.pm</p>

<p>
	And then during Makefile.PL, copy them to the build target as:<br>

	<br>

	lib/Net/FullAuto/bundled/Class/Tiny.pm<br>

	<br>

	And then load that path into @INC prior to loading the dependencies from it.<br>

	<br>

	( like <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://is.gd/l9cgzI&#38;nbsp">http://is.gd/l9cgzI&#38;nbsp</a></span>; )</p>

<p>
	And then you can disable the &quot;install bundled&quot; logic conditionally upon an ENV flag and revert back to &quot;use dependencies&quot;,<br>

	<br>

	( like <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="https://metacpan.org/source/BINGOS/ExtUtils-MakeMaker-7.04/Makefile.PL#L49">https://metacpan.org/source/BINGOS/ExtUtils-MakeMaker-7.04/Makefile.PL#L49</a></span> )</p>

<p>
	This helps you for people who *want* to use CPAN deps and it certainly helps you better when it comes to vendor deployment ( But the state of your current codebase, just in Makefile.PL is such no vendor would touch it ). Keeping in mind, vendors do not need you to dumb things down for them, they&#39;re quite capable of sorting out dependencies =).</p>

<p>
	But in short, you&#39;ve been heading on your own in this direction for a long time, and this is actually working against you. Many of your problems and solutions could have reached better results had to come to #toolchain on irc.perl.org and chatted about them.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	And we really do encourage that so we can work out what your objective problems are one at a time, and find objective solutions to them that work for more people, and work in the way people who generally consume CPAN expect.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Think of it as free help that will make your code better, _and_ attract more users ;D</p>

This is GOOD advice - some of it I wasn&#39;t aware of. I actually can create
a fully bundled distribution, but your advice would certainly have made
things easier. I will study your advice and see what kind of both short
and longer term changes I can/need to make bring this &#34;monster&#34; more in
harmony with the CPAN ecosystem.

Thanks for the response!

<div class="message-stanza open">&gt;&gt; FullAuto uses a whopping 137 &#40;not including FullAuto

&gt;&gt; dependencies of dependencies. Send::Email - a module included in
&gt;&gt; FullAuto&#39;s dependency chain, has a huge number of dependencies all on
&gt;&gt; it&#39;s
&gt;&gt; own. So does Moose of course. As good as the cpan shell and installer
&gt;&gt; are,
&gt;&gt; I could never get it to correctly manage this massive dependency chain.
&gt;&gt; Inevitably, the installation would fail because of a missing dependency
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; one of the long sub-chains of dependencies. Not necessarily the fault of
&gt;&gt; CPAN itself either, because module authors themselves are of course
&gt;&gt; responsible for making sure their stuff plays well with others.
</div>&gt;
&gt; There are some practical solutions for these problems outside stomping on
&gt; files
&gt; that aren&#39;t yours.
&gt;
&gt; For instance, some applications use &#34;Fatpacking&#34;, an approach where cpan
&gt; modules are essentially &#34;Inlined&#34; as a step in the release process.
&gt;
&gt; Another approach is &#34;bundling&#34;, where you store the trees of dependencies
&gt; you
&gt; *can* safely install directly in somewhere like bundled/ , and then have
&gt; code
&gt; in Makefile.PL that copies those files into a prefix.
&gt;
&gt; For instance, say you wanted Class::Tiny to be &#34;bundled&#34; for some reason.
&gt;
&gt; You *could* do this by storing it in
&gt;
&gt; bundled/Class/Tiny.pm
&gt;
&gt; And then during Makefile.PL, copy them to the build target as:
&gt;
&gt; lib/Net/FullAuto/bundled/Class/Tiny.pm
&gt;
&gt; And then load that path into @INC prior to loading the dependencies from
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; &#40; like <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://is.gd/l9cgzI">http://is.gd/l9cgzI</a></span> &#41;
&gt;
&gt; And then you can disable the &#34;install bundled&#34; logic conditionally upon an
&gt; ENV
&gt; flag and revert back to &#34;use dependencies&#34;,
&gt;
&gt; &#40; like
&gt; <span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="https://metacpan.org/source/BINGOS/ExtUtils-MakeMaker-7.04/Makefile.PL#L49">https://metacpan.org/source/BINGOS/ExtUtils-MakeMaker-7.04/Makefile.PL#L49</a></span>
&gt; &#41;
&gt;
&gt; This helps you for people who *want* to use CPAN deps and it certainly
&gt; helps
&gt; you better when it comes to vendor deployment &#40; But the state of your
&gt; current
&gt; codebase, just in Makefile.PL is such no vendor would touch it &#41;. Keeping
&gt; in
&gt; mind, vendors do not need you to dumb things down for them, they&#39;re quite
&gt; capable of sorting out dependencies =&#41;.
&gt;
&gt; But in short, you&#39;ve been heading on your own in this direction for a long
&gt; time, and this is actually working against you. Many of your problems and
&gt; solutions could have reached better results had to come to #toolchain on
&gt; irc.perl.org and chatted about them.
&gt;
&gt; And we really do encourage that so we can work out what your objective
&gt; problems
&gt; are one at a time, and find objective solutions to them that work for more
&gt; people, and work in the way people who generally consume CPAN expect.
&gt;
&gt; Think of it as free help that will make your code better, _and_ attract
&gt; more
&gt; users ;D

While this is a good advise in general, I don&#39;t agree in this particular case. The root cause of the problems the author has, is that his module does just WAY too many things and there are established solutions to most &#40;if not all&#41; of them. It might sometimes be a good idea to implement things differently in order to progress. But I don&#39;t see it in this case.

It is also difficult to achieve in practise. You need to install more than a hundred modules on lots of different platforms. That&#39;s impossible to maintain for one person. Therefore we&#39;re using modules in the first place, don&#39;t we?

So, I&#39;d stay with my first advise: reduce the complexity of the module and/or split it off into separate pieces &#40;one for the actual automation, one for amazon aws maintenance, one for xen or whatnot&#41; and try it first with a bare minimum Makefile.PL &#40;as I already suggested&#41; and then work out where problems might remain.

<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Hi Tom,

Thanks for the response. A ticket may not be the &#34;best&#34; place for discussion of general
principles, but since we&#39;re exploring the best method of solving my multiple problems,
it might be reasonable for me to share my perspective on what my &#34;problems&#34; are.

I can certainly appreciate the concern my module arouses. It is admittedly an &#34;arrogant&#34;
module. Arrogant in the sense that &#40;especially in regards to it&#39;s installation&#41; the implicit if not always obvious assumption is that FullAuto will essentially &#34;own&#34; the local Perl installation. For ANY module to have such an assumption is anathema for computing going backwards in time.

I don&#39;t argue that at all.

In fact, there IS a built in WARNING screen in the Makefile.PL that highly suggests the use of an entirely separate Perl installation, that indeed, FullAuto can &#34;own&#34;. I&#39;ll have to review the code path to the WARNING and make sure it still appears for everyone.

But what about going FORWARD??? An Amazon EC2 micro server, is about as disposable a commodity if there ever was one. Free Tier for a year, about $120 a year after that, and launch-able and destroy-able in a handful of minutes, is it really &#34;unthinkable&#34; for a powerful multi-host capable module to essentially &#34;assume&#34; it has a box/or Perl installation all to itself? &#40;And that is an exaggeration too, because FullAuto can indeed live happily will all kinds of other modules and scripts - the real issue is the need for updated modules that might break older scripts and other modules. I understand
that - Kent&#39;s advice is right on target with that need&#41;.

And since you can now create and destroy whole servers in less time than it takes to use the toilet,
is it unreasonable for guys like me to see a need for software installations that can leverage and
&#34;keep pace&#34; with that reality, even it means getting a bit creative in the short term?

What good is a server that can be launched in 2 minutes, if it then takes 2 days to set it up?

And yes, there is YUM and APT and RPM - but what about Windows? FullAuto works fully with Cygwin.
Plus with FullAuto, you have infinitely more potential configuration flexibility than you do
with any repository based images - whether machine or software.

I have just recently uploaded a video to YouTube demonstrating the full power and capability of this
module. I invite all who are interested to view it:

<span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/FfC_Ybdq07w">http://youtu.be/FfC_Ybdq07w</a></span>

I&#39;d be VERY interesting in hearing some of your perspectives on this, as it is VERY germane to the
direction the future of this module &#34;should&#34; go in.

Do I continue to build it up - or break it down? Can I get the exact same results you will see in
the video while following Tom&#39;s advice to the extent he advocates? Am I doing &#34;too much&#34;? And if so,
why is that a &#34;bad&#34; thing going forward?

However, proceeding from badly mistaken assumptions is fatal. This module is founded on the assertion that the only way to do the things sought, is in the way it is being done here. In particular, the idea that the only way to get things done is to &#34;take over&#34; the perl installation is not just badly flawed, but fatally so. That is why you have spent 15 years and are still only &#34;nearly there&#34;.

If you were prepared to revisit all your assumptions, and discuss them with the Perl Toolchain Gang on irc.perl.org/#irc, I think you would make rapid, significant progress.

I maintain multiple dmz&#39;s, each one with 50-100 servers, where each server is a HP blade. All of them run FreeBSD, and on top of it runs vast numbers of jails with services &#40;~1000 services per dmz&#41;. Each jail comes with its mounts &#40;via nfs&#41;, ip config, firewall, software, config, data, logging and whatnot. Jails can be moved from one server to another with one command and across dmz&#39;s.

So, if there&#39;s a new blade, I just boot it up. I boots a freebsd installer via netboot, installs a preconfigured image, registers itself etc and reboots. At this point the new blade is visible in monitoring, capacity management etc. On our management system I enter &#34;uhd-srv3455 add hjh-btomcat4&#34; and a jail with a tomcat for the customer &#34;hjh&#34; will be moved to the new blade and started up. The whole process from installation to the first service running takes a couple of minutes.

So, that&#39;s how we do it. Others do it differently, some with more manual work than others, some use commercial tools for this, some use inhouse solutions. There is a huge market for server deployment solutions and there are literally hundreds of systems available.

I don&#39;t like bashing on your module all the time, but you need to tune your assumptions and preconceptions in order to make anything good of it.

<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Thanks Tom,

Thanks for checking out the video. And I can&#39;t argue with you, there is a
LOT of things that have to be refactored. The reason I&#39;ve focused so much
on the &#34;what&#34; is because I&#39;m actually pursuing investment capital - and
there is genuine interest. With some of the money, I would hire a perl
consultant or two to focus JUST on the installation problems. A tech
writer or two for the documentation and training materials. Even a
BerkeleyDB consultant to tune the way I&#39;m using that.

Heck - I might even throw some money at the toolchain gang, if they&#39;d be
interested in getting their hands &#34;dirty&#34;.

I intend to make a proper lady out of this thing one way or another.

And yes, you&#39;re right, there are indeed a LOT of deployment tools. But I
like to think that FullAuto is &#34;more&#34; than a mere deployment tool, which
is why I&#39;ve called it a &#34;process automation utility&#34;. I can connect to
anything SSH &#34;persistently&#34;. Even Anisible, which claims to be &#34;agentless&#34;
has a dependency on Python being on the remote nodes. FullAuto has no such
dependency. As such, it can connect to routers and switches and other
devices that do not have Python available. Anisible also does not work on
Windows - FullAuto does with Cygwin.

You mentioned &#34;pre-configured&#34; images - the demo you saw manipulated a
&#34;naked&#34; image. NO pre-configured images to store or have to version. A
&#34;pre-configured&#34; image is essentially a hard-coded image &#40;loosely
speaking&#41;. Instead of a dozen &#34;pre-configured&#34; images for different
components, you can have just ONE FullAuto instruction set, that can have
infinite configuration change options.

But you&#39;re right - that is a bit &#34;off topic&#34;.

Thanks for sharing your experience - very interesting.

&gt; correspond. According to the documentation the module is about
&gt; automating tasks across servers using ssh and stuff like this.
&gt; 
&gt; In reality the module does, among other things:
&gt; 
&gt; - requests root permissions here and there &#40;see RT#97421&#41;
&gt; - installs and removes software &#40;local and remote&#41; like apache, mysql
&gt; and so forth
&gt; - maintains amazon ec2 and aws instances
&gt; - installs and removes perl modules
&gt; - creates and deletes files and directories in remote and local
&gt; directories
&gt; - calls tar, transfers tarballs, unpacks and removes them on various
&gt; occurences in the code
&gt; - creates/modifies crontab entries
&gt; - lot of more stuff I didn&#39;t have the time even trying to understand
&gt; 
&gt; While the documentation talks about security, the module nevertheless
&gt; stores passwords to berkeley db files. Yes, those are encrypted, but
&gt; what about the encryption key? It&#39;s stored elsewhere, since this
&gt; thing&#39;s main purpose is to run from cron. Obviously the author hasn&#39;t
&gt; ever heard of ssh keys.
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of notes about the code: it&#39;s a bloated mess in one 1.4 mb
&gt; file, FA_Core.pm. There are 174 subs, many of them are duplicates
&gt; &#40;e.g. there are 4 subs &#34;cwd&#34;&#41;. There are 36 packages within
&gt; FA_Core.pm, most of them declared inside subs. About 20-30% of the
&gt; code is redundant, i.e. duplicated all over the module. The file is
&gt; soo large, that it is impossible to understand for an outsider. It
&gt; uses hundrets of global variables for everything. While it uses lots
&gt; of external modules it also does many things on its own &#40;in weird
&gt; ways, e.g. handling of times and dates&#41;, eg:
&gt; 
&gt; %hourconv=&#40;&#39;12:00am&#39;=&gt;0,&#39; 1:00am&#39;=&gt;1,&#39; 2:00am&#39;=&gt;2,&#39; 3:00am&#39;=&gt;3, [..];
&gt; [..]
&gt; $hourstring=$hourconv{unpack&#40;&#39;x6 a*&#39;,$output-&gt;[4]-&gt;[0]&#41;};
&gt; 
&gt; Also there are hardcoded mime-types, path&#39;s, programs, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; The module should - if any - be rewritten from scratch. In its current
&gt; state it can&#39;t be trusted.
</div>
I will address each item one at a time:

</div></div>
Most of this type of code has been moved out and put in different modules that are specifically written for setting up NEW servers launched by FullAuto via the AWS EC2 API. When setting up a new server with software, needing root level privileges is unavoidable. Users need to provide credentials that have Administrator privileges activated for any of this to work on AWS EC2. There is no way that any of this code can be successfully used without the full knowledge and buy-in of those using it.

    class="message-stanza-folder closed"

</div></div>and so forth

That code is in a separate module called an &#34;Instruction Set&#34;. It&#39;s name is Liferay_is.pm and it is a module that &#34;instructs&#34; FullAuto in launching 3 servers via the EC2 AWS API and then provisioning those servers in turn, and finally cross configuring them, and starting up the entire architecture. This is an automated standup of a complete environment - NOT FROM PRE-BUILT IMAGES, but from source code and repositories. That&#39;s what FullAuto does, and it does it via persistent SSH and SFTP connections to these servers. Right now there are 5 &#34;demo&#34; &#34;instructions sets&#34; bundled with the distribution. Later these will be separated from the core bundle, and released independently.

There is also an instruction set that sets up a four node Hadoop cluster.

There is one that sets up a full working Catalyst server that will soon serve as a platform for coupling a RESTful API to FullAuto.

I fail to see how any of this can viewed as a &#34;problem&#34;. FullAuto was built to automate workloads like Chef, Puppet, Salt, Ansible and others do, with a LOT less overhead and more flexibility and ease of use.

</div></div>
NO - it does not. The demo &#34;instruction sets&#34; do launch from generic images, bu t there is no image &#34;maintenance&#34;. All image manipulation is done from code in the instruction set - NOT the core engine.

</div></div>
Again - this is code found in the &#34;instruction sets&#34;. Manipulating files is a common workload automation task. Again, I fail to see how this can be an issue?

</div></div> occurences in the code

Again - this code is now mostly found in instruction sets. However, there is code in the core that does dynamic mirroring of directories using a combination of sftp and ssh. It does a diff via &#34;ls&#34; output and bundles just the files that have changed, and does use tar to move those in order speed up the transfer. This functionality is currently undocumented, but will be documented soon. Again  I fail to see how this is a &#34;problem&#34;.

Again, an undocumented and not completely implemented feature. Not likely to be elevated anytime soon.

</div></div>
What &#34;standard&#34; are you suggesting? That it can be completely digested in 10 minutes, 10 hours or 10 days? The code is ALL there. Nothing is hidden. There is a LOT of it, but most of the superfluous stuff has been removed. What remains actually works and is a core feature - or is close to being one.

</div>
Nonsense - of course I&#39;ve heard of ssh keys, and the updated POD documentation strongly advises their use. Nevertheless, passwords are still prevalent, and if that is all that is available, then they can be used. And yes, the berkeley db treatment is hardly a &#34;perfect&#34; solution, but it beats storing passwords in cleartext. It&#39;s a compromise - and not even a very good one, but again, better than cleartext. I strongly urge the use of keys and identity files - and do frequently in the documentation. Using keys and identity files is supported and easy to use with FullAuto, and is documented, whereas the berkeley db stuff currently isn&#39;t.

</div></div>
Those are subs designed to work with Term::Menus and declaring a unique package within them prevents namespace collisions which was a big problem for me early on. These routines are subject to a form of code injection using Data::Dump::Streamer - which can see inside of closures. Nothing else at the time could that I was aware of. These subroutines need to be &#34;persisted&#34; in memory for dynamic menu creation.

I am guilty of some of this - and have been working to reduce a lot of this as time and opportunity permits. But it&#39;s not nearly as bad as you suggest.

Not &#34;impossible&#34; - that&#39;s absurd. Difficult? Yes - I admit that. And I can appreciate that you lack the incentive to do more than a cursory examination. However, I have NO doubt, that if I&#39;ve built something compelling that someone, and perhaps many, WILL take the time to tear it down and learn what it does and how it does it. The proof as they say - is in the pudding.

    onclick="fold_message_stanza(this, 'Show\x20quoted\x20text', 'Hide\x20quoted\x20text');">Show quoted text</span><br /><div class="message-stanza closed">&gt;&gt; The module should - if any - be rewritten from scratch. In its current
</div>state it can&#39;t be trusted.

Nonsense. Could it benefit from &#34;refactoring&#34; - yes of course, and that is an ongoing activity. The thing works - it works well, it performs well, it reports errors extremely well. I would not call that something that needs to be &#34;rewritten from scratch&#34;.

And as far as it being &#34;trustworthy&#34; - that is a call everyone is entitled to make on their own.

FullAuto is AMBITIOUS and highly unique software, and no amount of refactoring is going magically turn it into something an outsider can digest in 10 minutes.
The whole &#34;persistent connection&#34; capability is something that I am unaware of anyone else successfully using. Chef, Puppet, Salt all use remote agents. Ansible &#34;claims&#34; to be &#34;agent-less&#34; but in fact has a dependency on Python being on remote nodes. And it also has a dependency on OpenSSH persistConnect feature being activated. FullAuto has NONE of these dependencies, but can perform every bit as powerfully and perform the same kind of workloads no matter the size or complexity - and can do it with micro images in any cloud environment, and NO dependency requirements for the remote nodes. If you know of another framework that can boast that same capability - I&#39;m all ears!

One final thing - this project has been ongoing since 2000. My Perl skills are a 1000 times greater than what they were when I started the project. Would I do things differently if I was starting over? Certainly. But I&#39;m not starting over, and if a code construct works, works well, and solves a problem even if it&#39;s not a &#34;best practice&#34; way to do it, I&#39;m going to stick with it for the &#34;moment&#34; and refactor it only when it becomes convenient to do so. I have a lot of other things to attend to that have higher priority - unfortunately.
