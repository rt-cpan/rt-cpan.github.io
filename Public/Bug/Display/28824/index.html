 =head2 MOD_PERL 1.0
 Note that this module needs mod_perl-1.08 or higher, apache_1.3.0 or higher
 and that mod_perl needs to be configured with the appropriate call-back hooks:
+  
+  PERL_CHILD_INIT=1 PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS=1
 
 Apache::DBI v0.94 was the last version before dual mod_perl 2.x support was begun.
 It still recommened that you use the latest version of Apache::DBI because Apache::DBI
 versions less than 1.00 are NO longer supported.

+=head1 DO YOU NEED THIS MODULE?
+
+Note that this module is intended for use in porting existing DBI code to mod_perl,
+or writing code that can run under both mod_perl and CGI.  If you are using a
+database abstraction layer such as Class::DBI or DBIx::Class that already manages persistent connections for you, there is no need to use this module
+in addition.  &#40;Another popular choice, Rose::DB::Object, can cooperate with
+Apache::DBI or use your own custom connection handling.&#41;  If you are developing
+new code that is strictly for use in mod_perl, you may choose to use
+C&lt;&lt; DBI-&gt;connect_cached&#40;&#41; &gt;&gt; instead, but consider adding an automatic rollback
+after each request, as described above.

&gt; I made a mistake about how Rose::DB::Object interacts with Apache::DBI.
&gt; Here&#39;s a corrected patch.
