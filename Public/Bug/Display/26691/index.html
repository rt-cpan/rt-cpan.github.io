CHFR is climbing steady all week. UP over 23% since Monday, investors
are enjoying the solid climb. Read CHFR&#39;s recent news, and get on it
Thursday!

Brazil is not run by a coherent government, coordinated by a president
or prime minister, but by a grubby grouping of vested interests out to
enrich itself.
I can imagine her, being the new minister of tourism, bringing in
hundreds of thousands of &#34;Tourists&#34; to that city and making it the
wealthiest one on the planet within the next 4 years.
- You forget to mention your fight against children labor.
Clean the mess in your own.
It&#39;s just going to promote death, marginalization, poverty and the
destruction of the environment because it defends the interests of large
multinationals. &#34;- Kurt Weill, in a letter to music critic Olin Downes,

Of course, 0,50 Reais for the 3 decent meals, not per meal !
&#34;   We&#39;ll probably NEVER know the real truth because the brazilian
government won&#39;t allow us to know the truth! Large part of my upbringing

Lots of Plans on Earth and Out of Space. Genro was institutional
relations minister and is a veteran PT leader.
It was the responsibility of the next author to continue the story and
thus for months in a row. &#34;Make no mistake, this accord will only
benefit the multinationals and the elite. Agricultural, mineral, meat,
the commodity sector doesn&#39;t produce jobs. actually has an interest,

NOT being discovered and uncovered.
Yesssssssss Brazil, be proud of your economic performances and prowess.
he is second to God himself because God could have done it FREE ! There
is only good music and bad music. Brazil Reinvents Politics as the Art
of Getting Dirty and Still Win Brazilian Elections: Does Lula Deserve to
Win? I believe that this government can not produce anything good. Still
Lula has little to complain about since the new justice minister, Tarso
Genro, will not rock the boat.
Celebrities, Aspirin and Vultures in the Heart of Brazil&#39;s Amazon Who Is
Really Afraid of the FTAA?
Tell me, my portuguese teacher. There is an intellectual farce behind
the soap operas that is only sustained thanks to the colossal might of
the vehicle that supports them, Globo TV.
not as per ranting foreigners, but inept as per the Brazilian instructor
who trained the inept Brazilian Air Controller !
Denying Them Has Become a Cash Cow! DUE TO LACK OF TECHNOLOGY, LACK OF

&#34; Regardless, the voice of dissent articulated through the occupations

at least when I look at english to correct it I get it right.
As if were not enough the novelas we produce we still have to deal with
the imported ones - one of them is called Rebeldes &#40;Rebels&#41;. Lula was
