<div class="messagebody">
<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">GREETINGS!
I am sure this mail would be coming to you as a surprise since we have  
never met before and you would also be asking why I have decided to  
choose you amongst the numerous internet users in the world, precisely  
I cannot say why I have chosen you but do not be worried for I come in  
peace and something very positive is about to happen to your life  
right now and to the lives of others through you, if only you can  
carefully read and digest the message below. The internet has made the  
world global villages where you can reach anybody you have not met  
before.

Before I move further, permit me to give you a little of my biography,  
I am Mother Emily Olivier, 87 Years old woman and the wife of Late Sir  
Jackman Olivier who died in a Plane crash on Monday the 7th of  
September 1998 GMT 14:22 UK while they were flying from New York to  
Geneva. Please see site below for more information:  
<span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/index.html</a></span>

After the death of my husband I became the Head of his investment and  
now that I am old and weak I have decided to spend the rest of my life  
with my family and loved ones whom I never had time for during the  
course of my business life, but before the death of my husband we had  
a plan to use the last days of our lives to donate half of what we  
have worked for to the less privilege and charity homes and the other  
half  for ourselves, family members and close friends, and it is so  
unfortunate that my husband is not alive today to do this with me and  
I am very weak and old now, hence I have decided to do this  
philanthropic work on behalf of my late husband and I.
Presently, I have willed out almost half of our assets to several  
charity homes and to some of the less privilege in different countries.

Despite the agreement between my late husband and I to give aid to the  
deprived, we also agreed to render support to an individual we have  
not meet before in life due to the fact when we were still young in  
life we receive an anonymous help from an individual we did not know  
and which we have not being able to know till date, the impact we got  
from such gesture made us to do same.

I am sorry to inform you that you will never have the chance to know  
me because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I  
have agreed upon before his sudden death and you happened to be the  
beneficiary of our last WILL, irrespective of your previous financial  
status, hence I need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer that  
will cost you nothing.

I have presently deposited a Cheque in the sum of £5,800,000.00  
British Pound with FedEx express to deliver to you, what you have to  
do now is to contact the FedEx COURIER SERVICE as soon as possible to  
know when they will deliver your package to you because of the  
expiring date. For your information, I have paid for the delivering  
Charge, Insurance premium and Clearance Certificate Fee of the Cheque  
showing that it is not a Drug Money or meant to sponsor Terrorist  
attack in your Country.

You have to contact the FedEx COURIER SERVICE now for the delivery of  
your cheque with this information bellow;

Contact Person: Mr. Mark Robbins
Email Address: fedexukf@live.co.uk

Again, you are not to pay for the delivering Charge, the Insurance  
premium and the Clearance Certificate Fee of the Cheque because I have  
already paid for them, the only money you are expected to pay is  
£255.34 British Pounds for the security keeping of the cheque so far.  
I would have paid the fee but the company insisted that I should not  
because they don&#39;t know when you will be contacting them and to avoid  
demurrage or further cost.

You are to reconfirm the below information to them to avoid any  
mistake on the Delivery and ask them to give you the tracking number  
to enable you track your package over there and know when it will get  
to your address.

Postal address:
Full Names:
Direct telephone number:
Security Keeping Code: &#40;SCT/0433/FF&#41;

Below is the security keeping code: &#40;SCT/0433/FF&#41; of you draft, you  
are to also present it to them for verification before delivery.

Let me repeat again, try to contact them as soon as you receive this  
mail to avoid any further delay and remember to ask them to provide  
you with the method they wish to use in receiving their security  
keeping fee of £255.34 British Pounds for their immediate action.

Note: Please I do not want you to thank me or my husband all I need  
you to do is to invest wisely with it and do the same good to  
someone?s life someday as this is the only way this world would be a  
better community if we render selfless services to one another.

Be also notified that I will no longer be reading my emails or surfing  
the internet as I have retired completely from the outside world to my  
ranch, at this moment I have nothing to do with cars, emails and other  
luxuries, all further correspondence should be forwarded to the  
courier company for the delivery of your cheque to you.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. Emily Jackman Olivier.
