China Datacom Corp.
Sym: CDPN
Close: $0.065

CDPN announced Friday that is has acquired all outstanding shares of
General Link Information Systems, Chinas only GPS vehicle monitoring and
management system. GPS systems are huge; controlling that market is even
bigger. Read the news and get on CDPN first thing Monday!

Instead I will point to one reason, for which clear remedies to exist,
and immediate action could be taken.
Your diary will be constructed from a formal template that leaves a few
blanks for you to fill in. This exact approach was tried in Finland as
part of their LUMA project starting in 1992. And yet this is very much
how mathematics tends to be taught in our schools today.
of course, the more that do the better.
So why are you still reading this?
There is more to mathematics than mindlessly learning formulas and
recipes for solving problems. I have myself witnessed people in classes
parallel to mine going through this and after 10 years of studying the
language still being extremely uncomfortable with even the most basic
sentences. All of that, of course, will be taught using a formulaic
cookbook approach based on templates, with no effort to consider
underlying principles or the larger picture.
It is unfortunately the case that it is only at the upper levels of
education, such as university, that any broader conception about
mathematics becomes apparent. This is because mathematics, as the art of
abstraction, provides us the with ability to make simple statements that
have incredibly broad application. but those that do, usually seek it
out on their own curiousity.
there is plenty you are ignorant of, and always will be.
And yet this is very much how mathematics tends to be taught in our
schools today. This exact approach was tried in Finland as part of their
LUMA project starting in 1992.
What is lacking in mathematics instruction is any discussion of what
mathematics is, and why mathematics works as well as it does.
Mathematics has become hopelessly detail oriented. That reason is,
simply, that far too many people who teach mathematics are unaware of
the this broader view themselves.
it&#39;s important in life to have a good vocabulary and be able to
communicate your ideas well. This is because mathematics, as the art of
abstraction, provides us the with ability to make simple statements that
have incredibly broad application.
So why are you still reading this? there is plenty you are ignorant of,
and always will be.
In response perhaps the teachers and education system might decide that,
to help make English relevant to students, they need to introduce more
&#34;Applied English&#34;. Mathematics has become hopelessly detail oriented.
With so few people taking a real interest in the subject, teachers who
were truly passionate about English would become few and far between.
Finland has continued to do extremely well in other more recent &#40;though
less major&#41; studies.
Locating the superfluous comma will be a matter of systematically
identifying subjects, objects, and verbs and grouping them into clauses
until the extra comma has been caught.
well, so is the the chemical composition of steel, or the decay pathways
of uranium 235, or the implications of the turing machine, or the
importance of the homeobox gene family. A good mathematical theorem can
be like a succinct poem; but only if the reader has the context to see
the rich connections that the theorem lays bare. How many adjectives
does it contain?

Your diary will be constructed from a formal template that leaves a few

examples from &#34;real life&#34; &#40;for varying degrees of &#34;real&#34;&#41; where English
skills are important, like how to read a contract and locate the
superfluous comma.

view mathematics as an important subject or not, it is hard to deny
that, currently, it is being taught poorly in many countries around the
world.
