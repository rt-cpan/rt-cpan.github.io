Seems to be kind-of duplicate of #110049.

I do not agree that the test shouldn&#39;t fail. The test should fail, you as someone who is using software library telling other software about your home-directory layout need to know whether everything is as expected or not.

And then, with that information, that it&#39;s not as expected, you can either ignore &#40;install without tests&#41; or provide a patch which ensures integrity in another way the maintainer didn&#39;t realize.

OTOH: Use File::HomeDir::Tiny when you don&#39;t need the feature-rich File::HomeDir, it&#39;s much simpler and needs lesser tests ...

Objections?

Such directories can be removed or restored any time later. Likewise, they may become unreadable, the x bit may be unset, and so on. There are plenty of reasons why something can go wrong later.

Can you explain where you see an integrity issue if for example a blind person removes their directory ~/Photos? Yes, sorry, but it shows the point.

I don&#39;t use File::HomeDir directly. It&#39;s one of my dependencies.

Yes. ;&#41;

A lot of these &#34;standard&#34; directories don&#39;t exist on my two machines, a Mac and a Gentoo laptop. I have deleted those that I don&#39;t need, and the Gentoo installation was done so long ago, that these directories had never been creaeted. I have never run into issues with that because even software on the Mac simply prompts for another location if the expected one is not available. And that&#39;s the way it should be.

Furthermore, it is good practice to let _services_ run in as much isolation as possible. It&#39;s certainly not bad practice to give system users like &#34;nginx&#34; or &#34;apache&#34; their own private Perl environment. But does my nginx system user really need &#34;~/My Music&#34; or &#34;~/My Documents&#34;?

Besides, the tests are run for the user that *builds* the software, not the one that uses it. When I install File::HomeDir with sudo and my vendor&#39;s Perl the tests succeed. When I install it with perlbrew they fail.

The concept of a home directory is a well established standard. Dedicated directories for certain file types is nothing but a convention. Not even Apple or Microsoft enforce that convention. Why does a Perl module?

Sure. But you have one snapshot where it worked correctly - it was the time installing the module. So from there you can reconstruct ...

</div>&gt; 
&gt; Can you explain where you see an integrity issue if for example a
&gt; blind person removes their directory ~/Photos? Yes, sorry, but it
&gt; shows the point.
</div>
In such a case the module wouldn&#39;t simply install without extra effort &#40;disable tests&#41; and the failing test explain what was missing.
So you can record this and at any later point in time when a software fails which requires the photos, you know - test failed, could be the missing photos.

The module tests all it functions whether they work correctly or not. This ensures integrity of the implementation for the installed environment. Everything else would just be guessing ...

It always works correctly, whether the directory exists or not. A Unix user needs a home directory but it can be empty. In fact, not even the home directory has to exist.

I did.

My point is that these tests fail for conditions that are not errors at all. File::HomeDir provides a portable way to get the default locations for certain file types. If a software - whether it&#39;s using File::HomeDir or not - breaks just because such a location does not exist under certain conditions, then that software has a serious flaw. ENOENT and ENOTDIR are just two out of many error conditions and errors are there to be caught.

Maybe we just disagree? I also think that testing whether a file exists before opening it is a waste of time and a recipe for races. Then it&#39;s only natural that I don&#39;t see the point in testing whether a certain file exists on the build system for the build user at build time.
