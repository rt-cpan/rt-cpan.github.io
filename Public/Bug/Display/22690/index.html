<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">The attached file named GetArpNew.pl contains a program that reliably
demonstrates the problem.  The comment at the top of the file describes
the problem.  The program contains some hard-coded device names and a
community string that you&#39;ll have to change.  I attached the output
of a run.  It shows that get_table basically works, and works
without error when talking to some of my routers.  When it fails,
some of the values in the table it returns are junk.  Most of the
table is fine - it&#39;s just some entries that are junk.  It produces
the same output on multiple runs.

Here&#39;s some details about my system:

The devices that I am accessing are Cisco routers.

If I can get past this bug, I&#39;d like to replace SNMP_Session
with Net::SNMP throughout my program.  It is faster than SNMP_Session.
One interesting thing: when I change the first argument from &#39;snmpv2&#39;
to &#39;snmpv1&#39;, Net::SNMP is significantly slower than SNMP_Session. I
would&#39;ve assumed that they&#39;d run with similar times.

#
#	GetArpWithNetSnmp.pl
#
# This program demonstrates a bug in the Net::SNMP Perl module.
#
# The program is a simplified version of a production program called
# GetArp.pl.  The real GetArp program has been running successfully
# for years.  It uses SNMP to retrieve ARP information from routers.
# It uses the SNMP_Session module to do the actual SNMP communication.
# The SNMP_Session module works fine, but it doesn&#39;t directly support
# GETBULK, or SNMPv3, and the API is cumbersome.  The Net::SNMP module
# seems to be more popular and more current, and it supports GETBULK
# and SNMPv3, and it has a much more convenient API.  I want to
# convert GetArp to use Net::SNMP.  I want the basic function of
# GetArp to stay the same, except that it might run faster due to
# GETBULK suppert.
#
# I&#39;m a suspicious person, so I wrote this progrom to test that
# Net::SNMP actually returns the same data as SNMP_Session.  This
# program does the same SNMP access using both modules.  The results
# should be the same.  They aren&#39;t.  Net::SNMP seems to have a bug.
#
# I&#39;ve removed all the extraneous stuff that doesn&#39;t have to do with SNMP.

<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">What you are seeing is the expected behavior of the module. The
Net::SNMP module has translation enabled by default. When an OCTET
STRING is received, the contents of the string are checked to make sure
that all octets are printable. If any octet is not printable, the string
is translated into the hexadecimal representation.  If all of the octets
are considered printable by the module, then no translation takes place
&#40;which is what is happening in your case&#41;.  See ticket #18699
&#40;<span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18699&#41;">https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18699&#41;</a></span> for a more detailed
explanation.

Without further examination of what is going on, I can only guess on why
SNMPv2c is faster than SNMPv1.  The underlying framework for both v1 and
v2 is the same, however the get_table&#40;&#41; method uses get-bulk-requests
when the version is set to v2 instead of get-next-request.

&gt;
&gt; What you are seeing is the expected behavior of the module. The
&gt; Net::SNMP module has translation enabled by default. When an OCTET
&gt; STRING is received, the contents of the string are checked to make  
&gt; sure
&gt; that all octets are printable. If any octet is not printable, the  
&gt; string
&gt; is translated into the hexadecimal representation.  If all of the  
&gt; octets
&gt; are considered printable by the module, then no translation takes  
&gt; place
&gt; &#40;which is what is happening in your case&#41;.  See ticket #18699
&gt; &#40;<span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18699&#41;">https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18699&#41;</a></span> for a more detailed
&gt; explanation.
&gt;
&gt; Without further examination of what is going on, I can only guess  
&gt; on why
&gt; SNMPv2c is faster than SNMPv1.  The underlying framework for both  
&gt; v1 and
&gt; v2 is the same, however the get_table&#40;&#41; method uses get-bulk-requests
&gt; when the version is set to v2 instead of get-next-request.
