<div class="message-stanza plain-text-white-space">Dir Sir/Madam Developer,

I have been playing Catan for a long time. There are some issues I came
across while playing.
Let me give you the details;

1. After setting all the settlements, at the beginning of the game, the
very first roll is 7. This is very annoying to most players &#40;yes, I have
discussed the matter with other players as well&#41;. Ever since I realised
that, I started counting on my last games. Out of 30 games, 7 was the first
roll at 26 games!!! This is over 85%. This is a terrible bug that you
absolutely need to fix.
Imagine playing a game. Settling your villages on the proper place &#40;which
sometimes takes time to think of what resources you get and your next move,
possibilities, etc etc&#41;. Then the first roll is almost always 7! And your
resources &#40;by 50% possibility&#41; will get stolen.
This has become so annoying, that most games end up at first roll.
Someone rolls 7 and steals from a player. Then that player immediatly
leaves the game, to play another one, where he won&#39;t be the first victim of
the game.

2. You need to fix the rate of 7s. I understand you want to balance the
game somehow but the rate that 7s come it&#39;s just insane. There has been a
game that we were laughing with the other 2 players cause counted nine 7s
on a row! On A ROW! None stop. This only means we steal from each other,
but no new resources enter the game. This makes the game way too slow to
finish.

3. You also need to check the rest rolls. This is a general problem. Almost
at every game there will be ONE roll that, short of, gets &#34;stuck&#34;. In this
game maybe it will be 4. Next maybe 3. The other one maybe 10. The
frequency of that roll that gets &#34;stuck&#34; is just annoying. Getting 15-16
times the roll &#34;11&#34; out of 25 rolls for example, is simply ridiculous
&#40;especially if you think that 11 only comes out of the dice combination
5+6, which is only 1 combination out of 36 possible&#41;
In other words, you need to fix the dice roll system.

4. Knights and 7s. This is one is absolutely the worst bug that players
came to know. It is known among the players that if you FIRST play a knight
at your round, steal from a player and THEN roll the dice... somehow, for a
strange reason, the roll after your knight is almost bound to be 7. This
happens most of the times. Check this please, as many players get to steal
twice on the same round.
Also, that is kinda weird system. That completely ruins the 7s and Knights
logic. If the player who playes before me gets a 7 and steal from me, why
do I get to move the Knight BEFORE I ROLL? This doesn&#39;t make any sense. I
get blocked on a number, then I get to remove the thief, place it on
someone else, steal from them and then roll the dice and get even more
resources. This system is completely wrong. All the development cards
should be used AFTER you roll the dice. Think about the same thing; why
would a player use monopoly before rolling the dice? Less resources for
that player.

It would be really nice if you could fix these bugs and problems with the
game.
I love Catan, I&#39;ve been playing the actual board game with my friends for a
long time. I only wish that the online game could be a little bit more
realistic too.

Thank you!

This is the bug queue for a Perl interface to the Settlers of Catan game, and will not reach the company that owns the game. You need to send your concerns there.

In order to address your concerns regarding the statistical likelihood of rolling a 7, you may wish to consult the deity of your choice and request for the rules of mathematics to be rewritten.

&gt; &gt; game that we were laughing with the other 2 players cause counted nine 7s
&gt; &gt; on a row! On A ROW! None stop. This only means we steal from each other,
&gt; &gt; but no new resources enter the game. This makes the game way too slow to
&gt; &gt; finish.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. You also need to check the rest rolls. This is a general problem.
</div>&gt; Almost
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; at every game there will be ONE roll that, short of, gets &#34;stuck&#34;. In
</div>&gt; this
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; game maybe it will be 4. Next maybe 3. The other one maybe 10. The
&gt; &gt; frequency of that roll that gets &#34;stuck&#34; is just annoying. Getting 15-16
&gt; &gt; times the roll &#34;11&#34; out of 25 rolls for example, is simply ridiculous
&gt; &gt; &#40;especially if you think that 11 only comes out of the dice combination
&gt; &gt; 5+6, which is only 1 combination out of 36 possible&#41;
&gt; &gt; In other words, you need to fix the dice roll system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. Knights and 7s. This is one is absolutely the worst bug that players
&gt; &gt; came to know. It is known among the players that if you FIRST play a
</div>&gt; knight
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; at your round, steal from a player and THEN roll the dice... somehow,
</div>&gt; for a
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; strange reason, the roll after your knight is almost bound to be 7. This
&gt; &gt; happens most of the times. Check this please, as many players get to
</div>&gt; steal
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; twice on the same round.
&gt; &gt; Also, that is kinda weird system. That completely ruins the 7s and
</div>&gt; Knights
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; logic. If the player who playes before me gets a 7 and steal from me, why
&gt; &gt; do I get to move the Knight BEFORE I ROLL? This doesn&#39;t make any sense. I
&gt; &gt; get blocked on a number, then I get to remove the thief, place it on
&gt; &gt; someone else, steal from them and then roll the dice and get even more
&gt; &gt; resources. This system is completely wrong. All the development cards
&gt; &gt; should be used AFTER you roll the dice. Think about the same thing; why
&gt; &gt; would a player use monopoly before rolling the dice? Less resources for
&gt; &gt; that player.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It would be really nice if you could fix these bugs and problems with the
&gt; &gt; game.
&gt; &gt; I love Catan, I&#39;ve been playing the actual board game with my friends
</div>&gt; for a
<div class="message-stanza open">&gt; &gt; long time. I only wish that the online game could be a little bit more
&gt; &gt; realistic too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you!

&gt; This is the bug queue for a Perl interface to the Settlers of Catan game,
&gt; and will not reach the company that owns the game. You need to send your
&gt; concerns there.
&gt;
&gt; In order to address your concerns regarding the statistical likelihood of
&gt; rolling a 7, you may wish to consult the deity of your choice and request
&gt; for the rules of mathematics to be rewritten.
