SREA hit price spikes of 600% last week and is still hold at a 300%
increase as Market Makers are pushing it down to grab control.
Stockprofiler.us, Businessnewsnow.us, &#38; OTCPicks.com all pick it to take
off. Get in on the Market Makers play and grab SREA first thing
Wednesday!

Should it be in heavy rotation, light rotation, or banned from the
playlist outright?
An impressive number, to be sure.
Or confusion best avoided?
&#34;  The LAUNCHcast name has been retained for the time being. Album and
artist ratings can be put to good use Although I agree with the
song-centered approach to rating, I still think the album is an
important unit of music. Nonetheless, there is plenty to be happy about.

Before, you were limited to streaming music or burning tracks to CD.

com This subscription service is more boutique than supermarket, more
library than jukebox. For Windows users, this includes the choice
between using the iTunes Music Store or the MSN Music Store for buying
downloads; Macintosh users are limited to buying from the iTunes Music
Store.

Other changes include a new &#34;mini-mode&#34; for conserving screen space, and
skins for changing the player&#39;s appearance. It strikes me as a more
&#34;grown-up&#34; service.
Then assign high ratings to your favorite artists. Opera fans worldwide
are finding it addictive.
If you&#39;re looking for modern or experimental classical music, try
Iridian Radio, whose tagline reads &#34;music that&#39;s smart, but still warm
to the ears. One key difference is that Yahoo&#39;s offering is
significantly cheaper, and charges no premium for the ability to rent
tracks &#34;to-go&#34; for use on portable music players.
Timothy Noah at Slate Magazine recently wrote a two-part article
documenting his struggle to find a customer support phone number for the
iTunes Music Store.
Before, you were limited to streaming music or burning tracks to CD. The
LAUNCHcast User Group is a good example, with Yahoo staff answering
questions alongside other users.
As an alternative and addition to Rhapsody&#39;s own Playlist Central, FIQL.
This is the biggest collection available from a classical-only on-demand
service.

Once you&#39;ve submitted a playlist, you&#39;ll receive an e-mail asking you to
confirm your submission, after which you&#39;ll have the option of editing
it and adding comments. If you&#39;re keen on a portable, downloads &#34;to-go&#34;
subscription, and willing to buy a compatible music player, then Yahoo
is a much better value. When it comes to browsing, discovering, and
sharing classical music, it is the best of the general online music
services. The difference has been made up with links to external radio
stations not produced by MSN.

For more on the iTunes Music Store, see the profile on this site. In
addition to regular classical programming they have an archive of
&#34;discovering music&#34; classical programs. com is &#34;not just a pop music
service with classical as an afterthought. The toolbar lets you search
the eMusic catalog, and provides quick access to a free &#34;download of the
day. If you&#39;re keen on a portable, downloads &#34;to-go&#34; subscription, and
willing to buy a compatible music player, then Yahoo is a much better
value. This, of course, is depressingly the norm when it comes to
consumer software and online services, and isn&#39;t likely to change
anytime soon. Recordings can be searched for by composer, performing
group, and performing artist. Enter E-mail address:

In addition to regular classical programming they have an archive of
&#34;discovering music&#34; classical programs.
Then there is Accuradio, which offers six classical stations and lets
you personalize them by deselecting artists from the mix.

Should it be in heavy rotation, light rotation, or banned from the
playlist outright? Failing this, services should support online forums
where customers can help each other.

eMusic Expands Classical Offering, Adds Naxos Recordings Finding
Four-Star Jazz on eMusic eMusic Now Offering a Discount for Annual
Subscriptions What&#39;s a Classical Music Lover to do?
org &#34;a road map to digital music&#34; Douglas FlorzakForeWordReviews What&#39;s
a Classical Music Lover to do?
Yahoo&#39;s interface is not as appealing as Rhapsody&#39;s, and has more of a
promotional feel to it. The radio streams are a good idea, but have not
been taken to their logical conclusion: that they be used for
discovering music in the eMusic catalog.
Five ad-free classical radio stations are also provided. The LAUNCHcast
User Group is a good example, with Yahoo staff answering questions
alongside other users.

I just have an innate need to rate one song a little higher than
another.

Over the years, this combination has proved to have real staying power.
Licensing issues with record labels have placed constraints on how the
stations can work, and in some cases, the music that can be played. If,
in turn, the album isn&#39;t rated, but the artist is rated, then the artist
rating will apply to the song, and so on.
com, this won&#39;t be a problem.

com got out of the consumer market to focus exclusively on selling
subscriptions to libraries. Music can be browsed by composer, artist,
conductor, ensemble, instrument, genre, period, and record label.

Yahoo has lowered the price of Musicmatch On-Demand to match the price
currently being offered for Yahoo Music Unlimited.

Yet, I&#39;ve almost always been happy with my station. It is therefore no
surprise that all three services are used by libraries and educational
institutions. This means never releasing software that hasn&#39;t been
thoroughly tested and debugged. I just have an innate need to rate one
song a little higher than another. com site, recently launched to
facilitate playlist sharing, now offers playlists in Rhapsody format,
among others. For more on eMusic, see the profile on this site.
