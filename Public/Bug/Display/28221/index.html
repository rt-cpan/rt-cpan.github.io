Howard goofed on Gary about the pictures he was looking at because his
girlfriend was working on a sand sculpture and this guy is standing
there nude with his penis right near her face.

NorthY How many states are in the US? YThreeY Can you name one Poultry.
He said it was tough to come up with something like that. She was
wondering what was up with him picking Cheryl Tiegs for his movie.

Darlene said &#39;&#39;Devil&#39;&#39; as the next name but it wasn&#39;t on the board.
Gilbert did his Pope impression again and had some fun goofing around
with that.
Howard started off the show asking Robin how her weekend was.
Gilbert did his Pope impression again and had some fun goofing around
with that. Gary came in and told Howard that Vincent was a chronic
masturbator when he was younger.

Artie said he&#39;s going to be talking to him before he flies out to do a
gig on Thursday so that&#39;s a good thing.
Howard agreed and let him play.

He said the guy was very cool and made him feel very comfortable. seems
to be more compassionate than the rest of his family.

After all of that Vincent never whacked off to any women out in public
again.

Howard told her that he&#39;d defecated in his pants.

Vincent said that many things that he has wished for, both good and bad,
have actually come through.

Gilbert kept doing his racist Pope stuff throughout the rest of Robin&#39;s
news segment. Gilbert did his Pope impression again and had some fun
goofing around with that. Howard said he was going to call Gary to yell
at him over the weekend but he held off.
FourY How many pints are in a quart?

Scott DePace called in and asked Daniel if he would save Robin if she
was drowning.
He said he&#39;s supposed to see him again this Thursday so he&#39;s kind of in
therapy with him. Then a fly started flying around his ass so he put his
pants back on. It was a line about the movie being like a steaming pile
of excrement is what got to him.
Howard wrapped up the interview shortly after giving William a few more
plugs for his new album.
Howard talked to Vincent about how he likes feeling alone and won&#39;t get
married. William said he would never do anything like that for any
amount of money. were up at the buzzer and Daniel came in with Jesse
Jackson but didn&#39;t get it. Howard and Robin started goofing on him about
that as soon as they heard it. He is the focus of tens of thousands of
people who pray for him every day.
was up and said &#39;&#39;Movie Star&#39;&#39; and got the third wrong answer so they
threw it over to Wendy&#39;s family.
Howard just wanted to know if it was good oral. Daniel and his family
seem to think that it was God cleaning up New Orleans.

There were a few delay hits during this discussion so we missed out on
some of it. Gilbert would interrupt every story.
Robin suggested he make it his bedroom.

Howard told her they were playing the game and he wasn&#39;t going there.
YThreeY Can you name one Poultry.

said that they both watch black comedians and make fun of them so they
have watched &#39;&#39;The Jeffersons&#39;&#39; and shows like that over the years.
&#39;&#39; William said that&#39;s one he will not do because he&#39;s trying to become
a legitimate singer. Wendy said &#39;&#39;Bowl&#39;&#39; and her family couldn&#39;t come up
with the correct answer so they lost the points again. Vincent said he
actually talked about how he made the movie for himself and it was kind
of self indulgent.

He got the first three correct so he won right away.
Gallo said that Ebert is a nice guy and it&#39;s nice to see him on a better
diet now. He said that it was cool to see it but he could see why it
didn&#39;t get that great of reviews. He was just being honest with William
and he can&#39;t believe that William doesn&#39;t pleasure himself.

In the call we hear Doug Goodstein and Mike Gange on speaker with Andrea
and she&#39;s telling them that her boyfriend just threw a bottle of lube at
her. Ablow gave him all of his phone numbers and told him to call him
anytime he needs him. what he thinks about gay people.

He said that Scott DePace showed up with his kid so he was going to
teach him how to play baseball so that&#39;s why he had the glove.
William said that he would like to hear &#39;&#39;Winter Wonderland. William
asked &#39;&#39;What do you mean?
