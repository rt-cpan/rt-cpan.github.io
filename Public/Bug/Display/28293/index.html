Shandong Zhouyuan Seed and Nursery Co., Ltd &#40;SZSN&#41;
$0.38 UP 15% &#40;9:36AM EST&#41;

SZSN continues to climb as more great news unfolds. Read the news and
get on SZSN today!

Perhaps there are better men and women than me out there who can shrug
off a wet-pantsed man sitting behind them while they&#39;re trying to work.
And I was sure that vegetables were just an accompaniment to meat, akin
to what sugar is to tea for example; it doesn&#39;t exactly make a
refreshing drink on its own.
The other way, of course, is that one day I&#39;ll attempt to sit down, slip
around the seat, fall over, and end up face-down and ass-up in the
bathtub. So you could say I&#39;m a prime candidate for GPS assistance.

So there you have it.

Do it as it feels natural or you&#39;ll suddenly have a meat binge and feel
guilty.

I &#39;sauntered&#39; for a while, &#39;ambled&#39; around one corner, and &#39;strolled&#39;
for nearly a whole block.
Maybe we won&#39;t pee on your infielders as we round the bases, or splash
your catcher as we swing.

And there could be just a smidge of confusion about what to order at the
bar now.

And once you&#39;ve finished your business, you tend to figure it&#39;ll be
someone else&#39;s problem next.
I&#39;m reassured that they&#39;re eating some good stuff up there in heaven.
But not particularly well.

I&#39;m not going to get very far without the car; I&#39;m starting to feel like
I&#39;m under house arrest, without all the judiciary flip-flops and
courtroom histrionics.

The whole premise of the on-camera slaughters was to say &#34;in Britain we
don&#39;t know where our food comes from, and we should. Let&#39;s get
crack-ing, shall we?
Perhaps there are better men and women than me out there who can shrug
off a wet-pantsed man sitting behind them while they&#39;re trying to work.

For the best part of my gap year, my regular lunch was a bacon and
sausage bap and I couldn&#39;t think of a better marriage of meat products.

It was a lunchtime like any other around my new office.
After all, you&#39;re only responsible for the purchase, right?

I consulted my cheat sheet and even tried a few variations. I&#39;m trying
to fix &#39;Team Guinness&#39; right now.
I&#39;d just seen a bunch of kids lose their lunches on the Tilt-A-Whirl; I
just thought it was &#39;that kind&#39; of amusement park. I&#39;d just seen a bunch
of kids lose their lunches on the Tilt-A-Whirl; I just thought it was

We lost a second baseman for the season last year for wearing shorts
with writing on the ass. The other way, of course, is that one day I&#39;ll
attempt to sit down, slip around the seat, fall over, and end up
face-down and ass-up in the bathtub. As usual, I half-watched whilst
doing something else.

All I know is that they were wet, they&#39;d been wet for some time,
apparently, and the wetness of said pants was common knowledge.

&#34;These days, it&#39;s a little like trying to poop in the dead center of one
of those twirling teacups at DisneyWorld. I was one of those people and
had absolutely no reason to challenge my point-of-view.

By late May, it&#39;s an oppressive eighty-five.

It&#39;s the wall most meat eaters have, the one that separates what you see
in the field with what you see on your plate.

And in my case, slightly wetter. If I miss a highway exit, I&#39;ll do
doughnuts through the next rest stop and hope it works itself out.

You&#39;re wondering which wall, aren&#39;t you? I was one of those people and
had absolutely no reason to challenge my point-of-view.

I feel like I&#39;ve stepped over a line somehow. And quite possibly our
pants. It&#39;s the wall most meat eaters have, the one that separates what
you see in the field with what you see on your plate. So I guess it&#39;s
back to the janitors&#39; closet for me. Chris Wood was a meataholic and
proud. As of now, it looks like Smoltz will make his next start.

Which is neither easy to do, nor well appreciated by anyone in the
vicinity.
I knew this anniversary present thing would bite in the ass eventually.
The first was Jamie Oliver&#39;s Italy series. Most importantly, it&#39;s in an
area where we&#39;re allowed to have food and drinks.

While looking for emergency horse and buggy rental information on the
internet, I came across something called &#39;walking&#39;.

Some are too hot, or too cold, or too bright, or too dark, and some look
and feel and smell like janitors&#39; closets. I&#39;m not going to get very far
without the car; I&#39;m starting to feel like I&#39;m under house arrest,
without all the judiciary flip-flops and courtroom histrionics.
I was raised on Lancashire Hot Pot and it was my favourite meal for
years.
&#39; I still don&#39;t know what compelled me to say it.

It was just too much trouble to repair it, and I would have been anxious
about it falling apart again. That wall represents a funny paradox.
