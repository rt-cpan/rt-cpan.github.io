ARE YOU LIKE ME, TRYING TO MAKE A DECENT LIFE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY? HAVE YOU LIKE ME APPLIED TO ADVERTS FOR WORK FROM HOME? ARE YOU ALSO FED UP WITH RECEIVING PHONE CALLS FROM CLEANING BROCHURE COMPANIES OR LETTERS STATING THEY HAVE A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY - JUST SEND X AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEY WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT? IF SO, THEN BE LIKE ME AND READ THIS LETTER CAREFULLY AND THEN DECIDE WETHER YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS REAL OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A SECOND INCOME. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THEN MAYBE READ IT AGAIN. I DID.
DONT THROW THIS AWAY
My name is Jim Barrow. In October 2007, I did not have a penny to my name. I had lost my business, my home, my family and ended up on my own in a B&#38;B. My car was repossessed and debt collectors were making my life a misery. My life was a mess. In February 2008, quite out of the blue, I received this letter, which you are now reading, giving me the opportunity to earn Ã‚Â£2,000 in just 60 days without really doing very much. Naturally, I didn&#39;t believe a word of it. I had nothing to lose and in my situation, it was a bit of hope to get at least a little money in return for trying what seemed to be a simple plan. By June of that year, my life could not have been more different.
TO DATE, I HAVE LEGALLY MADE Ã‚Â£12,354. Its not a crazy amount of money as this is NOT a get rich quick scheme but it isnt too bad for someone who was facing bankruptcy and it helped me get my life back on track.

The system works perfectly everytime and I have never failed to make money each time I have done a mailing. This is a legitimate opportunity and a perfectly legal money-making plan. It does not require you to sell anything or to come into contact with any people. Best of all, you can do it sitting it front of your computer. If you believe you are due and deserve a lucky break, then this is it. Simply follow the instructions exactly and you cant go wrong.

STEP 1: Firstly you will need to open a Paypal account if you havnt already got one, which can be done at &#34;<span class="clickylink"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.paypal.com">http://www.paypal.com</a></span>&#34; and dont worry as it is completely free. Paypal is rather like an online bank and is widely used all over the world. When you open your account you will be asked for an email address, this email address is how the people will make payment to you so make sure it is yours and that it is valid. Send only Ã‚Â£1 to each of the 5 email address&#39;s below using your Paypal account by clicking on &#34;Make a payment&#34; once you have logged into your account. With your message you should attach a message asking to be added to their list. For example the message I leave is &#34;Please add me to your mailing list&#34;. This is a legitimate service for which you are paying a Ã‚Â£1 fee. All in all it will cost you only Ã‚Â£5 each time you use the system. 

If you fail to do this, you are operating illegally and the system will not work as it is intended!

The Email List
1. monkeytrucker@hotmail.co.uk 
2. melchiah_klan@hotmail.co.uk 
3. galina.k57@mail.ru 
4. emma_candygirl@hotmail.com 
5. jimbarrow@hotmail.co.uk

STEP 2: Retype this email and remove number one from the above list. Move the remaining names up the list &#40;i.e. number 2 becomes number 1 etc&#41; and add your own email address at position number 5. Notice how my email address is at position 5.

STEP 3: Send your newly edited email which now has your email address at position number 5 to at least 50 of your friends and family or people that you think might like to take part in the system. Remeber that the more emails you send out, the more you will earn. You can also purchase email lists of people who have opted to recieve opportunities like this from several online companies. This is not essential but can be done to improve your income. To do this simply search for &#34;Email Lists&#34; in any search engine like Google. This has proven to be an effective way for many people, as these are the companies you give your details to when you have answered adverts for working from home etc. 

STEP 4: Once you have sent your emails and have made your five Ã‚Â£1 payments to the people in the list above you are done and dusted and only need to wait for the payments to start coming into your Paypal account. You can then transfer the money to you regular bank account or leave it there to use for buying goods online with one of the many companies that accept Paypal like Ebay.

PLEASE NOTE: As soon as you send your emails, you are in an email business and people are sending you Ã‚Â£1 to be placed on your mailing list. THIS IS PERFECTLY LEGAL. You can repeat this system as much as you like but you MUST send the five Ã‚Â£1 payments to the people on the email list each time you do. This system only works because of the honest people who make these small payments each time they use the system. If you dont make the payments then this system WILL NOT work.

Now for the interesting part, based on a conservative response rate of 7.5%
By sending out 200 emails                                 15 people will send you Ã‚Â£1 Ã‚Â£15
Those 15 will send out 200 emails                      225 people will send you Ã‚Â£1 Ã‚Â£225
Those 225 will send out 200 emails                    3375 people will send you Ã‚Â£1 Ã‚Â£3375
Those 3375 will send out 200 emails                  50,625 people will send you Ã‚Â£1 Ã‚Â£50,625
The total amount received by 60 days would be Ã‚Â£54,420!! 
Ofcourse you most probably wont get Ã‚Â£54,420 as your response rate could be much lower however even a low response rate of 2% would bring in enough money to make you smile. The above example is to show you how the system works and so the more emails you send the better your chances.

If you are still undecided as I was, then consider the following, This IS a way of making money that really works. If you follow the instructions given to you in this letter, then you will be better off. You CANNOT lose. There is a very low initial outlay, as I pointed out earlier, but look at the potential gains! What if the return on your mailing list is a 10% response? You would soon be debt free and alot better off. Forget the lottery. THIS IS FAR BETTER.

Here is a letter from a participant in this scheme - Miss J Greenwood:
I am a very sceptical person by nature. However, I thought there was something different about Jim Barrows letter. I am a single mother with two children and did not have much money to spare at the best of times. I took a chance and sent the five Ã‚Â£1 payments and decided to send out 400 emails and hoped for the best. Each morning, I checked my Paypal account and had nothing for 16 days. On the 17th day I received Ã‚Â£167 and then, over the next 40 days, I received an amazing Ã‚Â£67,879 through the post. This really does work and I am glad I took the chance on this brilliant business plan.

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:
As we are ordinary people trying to be secure, please play the game fairly. Be honest with people and do unto them as you would want them to do unto you. DO NOT TRY TO SHORTEN THE STAGES. The benefits will be much less and the people on the list have already payed out money to give you this chance. So PLEASE follow each step correctly.
Do give some money to charity in recognition of your changed future.
IF YOU ARE STILL SCEPTICAL, RE-READ THIS LETTER! YOU REALLY DO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AND ALOT TO GAIN.
HAVE FUN WITH YOUR MONEY AND GOOD LUCK.

Jim Barrow
